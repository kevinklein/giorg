The law would become effective January 2018.\r\n<br>\r\nThe bill, as passed, prohibits insurers from requiring MOC for credentialing or reimbursement, and prevents the Texas Medical Board from requiring MOC for licensure.  Unfortunately, the Texas House made a last minute amendment to the original bill, which may in effect, still allow hospitals and facilities to require MOC for privileges.  Instead of including specific language which would prohibit hospitals from requiring MOC, the finalized language allows facilities to set a MOC policy, pending input and a vote by the hospital staff.\r\n<br>\r\nFinal language regarding hospitals:\r\n<br>\r\nExcept as otherwise provided by this section, the following entities may not differentiate between physicians based on a physician's maintenance of certification: if the facility or hospital has an organized medical staff or a process for credentialing physicians; \u2026.\r\n<br>\r\n(b)  An entity described by Subsection (a) may differentiate between physicians based on a physician's maintenance of certification if:\r\n<br>\r\n(1)  the entity's designation under law or certification or accreditation by a national certifying or accrediting organization is contingent on the entity requiring a specific maintenance of certification by physicians seeking staff privileges or credentialing at the entity; and\r\n<br>\r\n(2)  the differentiation is limited to those physicians whose maintenance of certification is required for the entity's designation, certification, or accreditation as described by Subdivision (1).\r\n<br>\r\n(c)  An entity described by Subsection (a) may differentiate between physicians based on a physician's maintenance of certification if the voting physician members of the entity's organized medical staff vote to authorize the differentiation.\r\n<br>\r\n(d)  An authorization described by Subsection (c) may:\r\n<br>\r\n(1)  be made only by the voting physician members of the entity's organized medical staff and not by the entity's governing body, administration, or any other person;\r\n<br>\r\n(2)  subject to Subsection (e), establish terms applicable to the entity's differentiation, including:\r\n<br>\r\n(A)  appropriate grandfathering provisions; and\r\n<br>\r\n(B)  limiting the differentiation to certain medical specialties; and\r\n<br>\r\n(3)  be rescinded at any time by a vote of the voting physician members of the entity's organized medical staff.","image":"","color_map":"#7798BA","color_map_over":"#366CA3"},"st45":{"id":45,"name":"Utah","shortname":"UT","link":"","comment":"","image":"","color_map":"#7798BA","color_map_over":"#366CA3"},"st46":{"id":46,"name":"Vermont","shortname":"VT","link":"","comment":"","image":"","color_map":"#7798BA","color_map_over":"#366CA3"},"st47":{"id":47,"name":"Virginia","shortname":"VA","link":"","comment":"","image":"","color_map":"#7798BA","color_map_over":"#366CA3"},"st48":{"id":48,"name":"Washington","shortname":"WA","link":"","comment":"","image":"","color_map":"#7798BA","color_map_over":"#366CA3"},"st49":{"id":49,"name":"West Virginia","shortname":"WV","link":"","comment":"","image":"","color_map":"#7798BA","color_map_over":"#366CA3"},"st50":{"id":50,"name":"Wisconsin","shortname":"WI","link":"","comment":"","image":"","color_map":"#7798BA","color_map_over":"#366CA3"},"st51":{"id":51,"name":"Wyoming","shortname":"WY","link":"","comment":"","image":"","color_map":"#7798BA","color_map_over":"#366CA3"}}    ,groups          : {}    ,points         : {}    };
