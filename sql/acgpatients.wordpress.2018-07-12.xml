<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer/" class="faqquestion">What is Colorectal Cancer?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Colorectal (large bowel) cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the inner lining of the colon or rectum. Together, the colon and rectum make up the large bowel or large intestine. The large intestine is the last segment of the digestive system (the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine are the first three sections). The large bowel's main job is to reabsorb water from the contents of the intestine so that solid waste can be expelled into the toilet. The first several feet of the large intestine is the colon and the last 6 inches is the rectum.  </p>
<p>Most colon and rectal cancers originate from benign wart-like growths on the inner lining of the colon or rectum called polyps. Not all polyps have the potential to transform into cancer. Those that do have the potential are called adenomas. It takes more than 10 years in most cases for an adenoma to develop into cancer. This is why some colon cancer prevention tests are effective even if done at 10-year intervals. This 10-year interval is too long, in some cases, such as in persons with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis, and in persons with a strong family history of colorectal cancer or adenomas.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer/" class="faqquestion">How common is Colorectal Cancer?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of  cancer-related deaths in the United States when men and women are considered  separately, and the second leading cause when both sexes are combined. It is  expected to cause about 50,310 deaths during 2014.</p>
<p>  Excluding skin cancers, colorectal cancer is the third  most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the United States. The  American Cancer Society's estimates for the number of colorectal cancer cases  in the United States for 2014 are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>96,830 new cases of colon cancer </li>
  <li>40,000 new cases of rectal cancer </li>
</ul>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer/" class="faqquestion">Colorectal Cancer screening options</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p><strong>What are the Colorectal Cancer screening options?</strong><br>
Talk to your doctor about what colorectal screening tests are right for you. Guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology distinguish between colorectal cancer prevention tests and colorectal cancer detection tests. According to ACG, prevention tests are preferred over detection tests.
 
<p><strong>Preferred Colorectal Cancer Prevention Test: Colonoscopy</strong><br>
Colonoscopy every 10 years is the preferred colorectal cancer prevention test. For normal risk individuals, the American College of Gastroenterology recommends colonoscopy beginning at age 50, and age 45 for African Americans.</p>
 
<p><strong>Preferred Cancer Detection Test:  Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) </strong><br>
Annual fecal immunochemical testing is the preferred colorectal cancer detection test. FIT is a relatively new test that detects hidden blood in the stool. If results are positive, a colonoscopy is performed.</p>
 
<p><strong>CT Colonography every 5 years</strong><br>
CT Colonography is an X-ray designed to look for colon polyps and cancers. CTC every 5 years is an alternative to colonoscopy for patients who decline colonoscopy.  If polyps are detected, a regular colonoscopy is required to remove these pre-cancerous growths. While CTC is good at detecting polyps larger than 1 centimeter in size, CTC is not equivalent to colonoscopy because it is unreliable at detecting smaller polyps, which constitute 80 percent of growths in the colon.</p>
 
<p><strong>Alternative Tests</strong><br>
Flexible Sigmoidoscopy every 5 to 10 years<br>
Annual Hemoccult<sup>Â®</sup> Sensa<sup>Â®</sup><br>
Fecal DNA Testing every 3 Years</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of Colorectal Cancer?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
						<p>Most early colorectal cancers produce no symptoms. This is why screening for colorectal cancer is so important. Symptoms of colorectal cancer vary depending on the location of the cancer within the colon or rectum, though there may be no symptoms at all. The prognosis tends to be worse in symptomatic as compared to asymptomatic individuals.</p> 
						<p>The most common presenting symptom of colorectal cancer is rectal bleeding. Cancers arising from the left side of the colon generally cause bleeding, or in their late stages may cause constipation, abdominal pain, and obstructive symptoms.</p> 
						<p>On the other hand, right-sided colon lesions may produce vague abdominal aching, but are unlikely to present with obstruction or altered bowel habit. Other symptoms such as weakness, weight loss, or anemia resulting from chronic blood loss may accompany cancer of the right side of the colon. You should promptly see your doctor when you experience any of these symptoms.</p>
						<p>Remember to promptly see your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>New onset of abdominal pain</li>
							<li>Blood in or on the stool</li>
							<li>A change in stool caliber or shape</li>
							<li>A change in typical bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea </li>
						</ul>
                        </div>
                        </li>
						<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer/" class="faqquestion">Why should you get checked for Colorectal Cancer even if you have no symptoms?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
						<p>Adenomas can grow for years and transform into cancer without producing any symptoms. By the time symptoms develop, it is often too late to cure the cancer, because it may have spread. Screening identifies cancers earlier and actually results in cancer prevention when it leads to removal of adenomas (pre-cancerous polyps).</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/colonoscopy-faqs/" class="faqquestion">What is Colonoscopy?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Colonoscopy is a procedure which enables a physician (usually a gastroenterologist) to directly image and examine the entire colon. It is effective in the diagnosis and/or evaluation of various GI disorders (e.g. colon polyps, colon cancer, diverticulosis, inflammatory bowel disease, bleeding, change in bowel habits, abdominal pain, obstruction and abnormal x-rays or CT scans) as well as in providing therapy (for example, removal of polyps or control of bleeding). It is also used for screening for colon cancer. A key advantage of this technique is that it allows both imaging of abnormal findings and also therapy or removal of these lesions during the same examination. This procedure is particularly helpful for identification and removal of precancerous polyps.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/colonoscopy-faqs/" class="faqquestion">What is a colonoscope?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>A colonoscope is a flexible and steerable instrument to evaluate the entire colon (large intestine). The large intestine is approximately 3 â 4 feet long. A colonoscope is engineered such that biopsies of suspicious areas can be obtained, and polyps (which may turn into cancer) can be removed.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/colonoscopy-faqs/" class="faqquestion">What is my risk of developing colon cancer if I live in the United States?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Your lifetime risk (defined as life to 85 years old) is approximately 6% (male or female). Your risk is roughly doubled if one (1) first degree relative (parent, sibling or child) had colon cancer or polyps after age 50, and is higher if the cancer or polyps were diagnosed at a younger age or if more members of your family are affected. Certain inherited disorders, for example, polyposis syndromes and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, can increase your risk of developing colon cancer, but those are rare. Other important risk factors include obesity, cigarette smoking, inflammatory conditions in the colon such as Crohnâs, colitis and ulcerative colitis, and excessive alcohol consumption. Your doctor is in the best position to discuss whether your personal or family history suggests one of those conditions.
</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/colonoscopy-faqs/" class="faqquestion">Has colonoscopy been shown to be effective in preventing cancer of the colon and saving lives?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Yes. Colonoscopy accomplishes this by detecting and removing polyps, and detecting early cancers. Recent data show that both the number of new cases of colon cancer (incidence) and deaths from the disease are decreased when colonoscopy is performed according to established guidelines (see Question 11).</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/colonoscopy-faqs/" class="faqquestion">If colonoscopy is so effective at detecting polyps, colon cancer and saving lives, why aren't more people having it?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The most common reason patients cite for not getting a colonoscopy is that their doctor did not discuss it with them. The next most common reason is fear or avoidance of the preparation (âprepâ), which involves taking a laxative which causes temporary diarrhea for several hours. In addition, many people are simply unaware that they need colon cancer screening.
</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/colonoscopy-faqs/" class="faqquestion">What is the "prep" for colonoscopy like? How many different preps are out there?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>This is an important obstacle in the eyes of many patients to getting a colonoscopy, but it need not be!</p>
<p>There are a variety of preparation methods for colonoscopy ranging from liquids (of varying quantity) with or without enemas, to pills, which rid your colon of feces. A clean colon is essential to allow for a careful examination for polyps or other abnormalities. Your doctor can discuss and prescribe the most appropriate preparation method for you, taking into account various factors such as your age, personal preferences, kidney function and physical stamina.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The most popular preparation used for colonoscopy involves drinking a volume of solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG). This solution causes a diarrhea that effectively rids the colon of its contents. Various fruit flavors are available and patients have several hours to drink it. Usually a patient will have clear liquids the day of the preparation (day before the colonoscopy) and then take half of the prep in the late afternoon or that evening. The other half is done approximately 5 hours before coming in for the test the following day. Patients are encouraged to drink a lot of fluids and to continue clear liquids up until 2 hours before their scheduled procedure. Before going to bed, many doctors also prescribe a laxative pill (e.g. DulcolaxÂ®) that helps with the evacuation process.</li>
  <li>Smaller volumes of solution (e.g. MoviPrepÂ®, HalfLytelyÂ®) or pill preparations (e.g. OsmoPrepÂ®) have also recently become available with similarly good outcomes to PEG for people who dread the thought of large volumes of liquid.</li>
  <li>Another preparation involves a phosphate solution (called FleetÂ® Phospho-soda) which consists of two (2) rounds of phosphate rich liquid of 45ml each the night before and day of the exam. It is essential to drink at least 2 quarts of water with these preps to replace losses.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, a phosphate tablet preparation of about 30 pills is available and is also very effective for colon cleansing and is preferred by some patients. This preparation also requires that you drink at least 2 quarts of water to replace losses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phospho-sodaÂ® prep should be avoided in patients with significant heart or kidney problems, in elderly patients who have difficulty maintaining hydration and with caution in patients with significant liver problems</p>
<p>The best method of colonic preparation should be discussed with the gastroenterologist so that a method that suits the patientâs preference may be selected.</p>
<p> </p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/colonoscopy-faqs/" class="faqquestion">Is colonoscopy painful? Will I be sedated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>No, colonoscopy is usually not painful! Almost all colonoscopies can be performed using âintravenous sedationâ or âtwilight sedationâ in which you are very drowsy, but comfortable and still breathing on your own. The most common type of sedation also has a mild amnesiac effect, so most patients do not even remember the procedure! Your doctor can discuss with you the best form of sedation to suit your needs.
</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/colonoscopy-faqs/" class="faqquestion">Will my insurance pay for this procedure?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Medicare (and most third party payers) will pay for colonoscopy for colon cancer screening, thanks to the hard work of advocacy groups and the efforts of national organizations such as the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG). Regrettably, a recent study showed a low compliance rate for screening (less than 30%) among Medicare patients.
</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/colonoscopy-faqs/" class="faqquestion">Are there any complications from colonoscopy?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Yes, but potential complications are associated with virtually every form of testing done in medicine. Clearly, colonoscopy has been found to be extremely safe when performed by a well trained physician such as a gastroenterologist. Although quite rare, most complications are related to sedation administration (cardiac and respiratory problems); the colon may also become partially torn (perforated) and this may require surgery. Rarely, bleeding from polyp removal or from the procedure itself may require additional treatment such as hospitalization and/or blood transfusions. As one reads about these procedures, the reader should weigh these low risks against the far more frequent complication of developing colon cancer if appropriate testing is NOT done.
</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/colonoscopy-faqs/" class="faqquestion">When should I have a colonoscopy?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>If you have no colorectal symptoms, family history of colon cancer, polyps or inflammatory bowel disease you should have your first exam at age 50 whether you are a man or a woman since colon cancer affects both EQUALLY! Recent evidence suggests that African Americans should begin screening earlier at the age of 45.</p>
<p>If one or more first degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had a precancerous polyp or colon cancer, the general guideline is to begin colon cancer screening 10 years younger than the youngest age of the family member with colon cancer, or age 40, whichever is younger. There are additional guidelines for suspected or confirmed rare syndromes, and you should discuss these options with your doctor.</p>
<p>For patients with ulcerative colitis involving the entire colon and patients with Crohnâs disease, screening for colon cancer should begin 8 â 10 years after the initial diagnosis is made.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The cause of colorectal cancer in most cases is unclear. However, most colorectal cancers develop from polyps, which are abnormal growths in the colon. If polyps grow unnoticed and are not removed, they may become cancerous. Screening tests can find precancerous polyps so they can be removed before they turn into cancer. The development of more than 75-90 percent of colorectal cancer can be avoided through early detection and removal of pre-cancerous polyps.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer/" class="faqquestion">Who is at risk for colorectal cancer?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Everyone age 50 and older</em></strong><em>.</em>
The average age to develop colorectal cancer is 70 years, and 93% of cases occur in persons 50 years of age or older. Current recommendations are to begin screening at age 50 if there are no risk factors other than age for colorectal cancers. A person whose only risk factor is their age is said to be at average risk.</li>
	<li><strong><em>Men and women</em></strong><strong>
</strong>Men tend to get colorectal cancer at an earlier age than women, but women live longer so they 'catch up' with men and thus the total number of cases in men and women is equal.</li>
	<li><strong><em>Anyone with a family history of colorectal cancer</em></strong><em>.</em>
If a person has a history of two or more first-degree relatives (parent, sibling, or child) with colorectal cancer, or any first-degree relatives diagnosed under age 60, the overall colorectal cancer risk is three to six times higher than that of the general population. For those with one first-degree relative diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age 60 or older, there is an approximate two times greater risk of colon cancer than that observed in the general population. Special screening programs are used for those with a family history of colorectal cancer. A well-documented family history of adenomas is also an important risk factor.</li>
	<li><strong><em>Anyone with a personal history of colorectal cancer or adenomas at any age, or cancer of endometrium (uterus) or ovary diagnosed before age 50.</em></strong><strong>
</strong>Persons who have had colorectal cancer or adenomas removed are at increased risk of developing additional adenomas or cancers. Women diagnosed with uterine or ovarian cancer before age 50 are at increased risk of colorectal cancer. These groups should be checked by colonoscopy at regular intervals, usually every 3 to 5 years. Woman with a personal history of breast cancer have only a very slight increase in risk of colorectal cancer.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>


<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer/" class="faqquestion">Colorectal Cancer screening for African Americans</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>African Americans are diagnosed with colorectal cancer at a younger age than other ethnic groups, and African Americans with colorectal cancer have decreased survival compared with other ethnic groups.</p>

<p>Guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology recommend that African Americans begin colorectal cancer screening at age 45 rather than 50 years.</p>

<p>Data support the recommendation that African Americans should begin screening at a younger age because of the higher incidence of colorectal cancer and a greater prevalence of proximal or right-sided polyps and cancer in this population.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<ul>
	<li>The strategy for reducing colorectal cancer deaths is simpleâCRC screening.</li>
	<li>For normal risk individuals, screening tests begin at age 50 and the preferred approach is a screening colonoscopy every 10 years; an alternate strategy consists of annual stool test for blood and a flexible sigmoidoscopic exam every 3 to 5 years.</li>
	<li>African Americans should begin colorectal cancer screening at age 45 rather than 50 years.</li>
	<li>Colonoscopic surveillance (also called screening colonoscopy) needs to be available at more frequent intervals for individuals at high risk for colon cancer (for instance, those with a personal history of colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps; family history of colorectal cancer; non-hereditary polyposis; colorectal cancer; or a pre-disposing condition such as inflammatory bowel disease. (Medicare provides for surveillance colonoscopy no more frequently than once every two years for those at high risk.)</li>
	<li>For both average and high risk individuals, all potential pre-cancerous polyps must be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recent observations suggest regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin, reduce the chances of colorectal cancer death by 30-50%. These drugs also have risks, particularly intestinal bleeding, and patients should consult their physician as to whether regular use of these agents is appropriate. Folate, calcium, and post-menopausal estrogens each have a modest protective benefit against colon cancer. A high fiber (vegetables) and low fat diet, regular exercise, maintenance of normal body weight and cessation of smoking are also beneficial. None of the measures is as effective as or should replace colorectal cancer screening.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Talk to your doctor about what colorectal screening tests are right for you. Guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology distinguish between colorectal cancer prevention tests and colorectal cancer detection tests. According to ACG, prevention tests are preferred over detection tests.
 
<p><strong>Preferred Colorectal Cancer Prevention Test: Colonoscopy</strong><br>
Colonoscopy every 10 years is the preferred colorectal cancer prevention test. For normal risk individuals, the American College of Gastroenterology recommends colonoscopy beginning at age 50, and age 45 for African Americans.</p>
 
<p><strong>Preferred Cancer Detection Test:  Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) </strong><br>
Annual fecal immunochemical testing is the preferred colorectal cancer detection test. FIT is a relatively new test that detects hidden blood in the stool. If results are positive, a colonoscopy is performed.</p>
 
<p><strong>CT Colonography every 5 years</strong><br>
CT Colonography is an X-ray designed to look for colon polyps and cancers. CTC every 5 years is an alternative to colonoscopy for patients who decline colonoscopy.  If polyps are detected, a regular colonoscopy is required to remove these pre-cancerous growths. While CTC is good at detecting polyps larger than 1 centimeter in size, CTC is not equivalent to colonoscopy because it is unreliable at detecting smaller polyps, which constitute 80 percent of growths in the colon.</p>
 
<p><strong>Alternative Tests</strong><br>
Flexible Sigmoidoscopy every 5 to 10 years<br>
Annual Hemoccult<sup>Â®</sup> Sensa<sup>Â®</sup><br>
Fecal DNA Testing every 3 Years</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/questions-and-answers-about-quality-in-colonoscopy/" class="faqquestion">Why is quality important in colonoscopy?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Although colonoscopy has been available in clinical practice for more than 40 years, only in the past 15 years has awareness developed that the success of colonoscopy in preventing colorectal cancer and minimizing complications is very dependent on the skill and competence of the colonoscopist. Colonoscopists differ substantially in the number of precancerous polyps they detect during colonoscopy and in how often they perform colonoscopy in response to both normal and abnormal findings. Awareness of these differences led the U.S. Multisociety Task Force on Colorectal Cancer in 2002, as well as a joint task force of experts from the American College of Gastroenterology and American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy in 2006, to propose quality indicators that colonoscopists can use to measure how effectively and safely they perform colonoscopy. Obviously, patients have an interest in undergoing the most effective and safe colonoscopy possible, and achieving these goals requires a colonoscopist who is committed to high quality.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/questions-and-answers-about-quality-in-colonoscopy/" class="faqquestion">Does the quality of examination differ among colonoscopists from different specialties?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Studies have shown average performance of colonoscopy by gastroenterologists to be superior to that of primary care physicians in three different areas of colonoscopy performance. First, three population-based studies have found that gastroenterologists performing colonoscopy are less likely to miss colorectal cancer than are primary care physicians who perform colonoscopy. This may reflect the more extensive training that gastroenterologists receive in this procedure and their higher volumes of colonoscopy in practice. Second, gastroenterologistsâ patients are less likely to incur serious complications during colonoscopy, such as perforation or making a hole in the colon, compared to primary care physicians. Third, gastroenterologists are less likely than both primary care physicians and general surgeons to perform colonoscopy at intervals that are considered too short according to current guidelines. Whether this difference reflects a lack of confidence among primary care physicians and general surgeons in the quality of their colonoscopy or lack of awareness of current guidelines is unknown.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/questions-and-answers-about-quality-in-colonoscopy/" class="faqquestion">Is there variation in quality of performance among members of the same specialty?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Even though gastroenterologists have on average the highest level of training and their examinations have been shown on average to be superior to primary care physicians, there is considerable variation among gastroenterologists in their detection rates of precancerous polyps. Therefore, it is essential that every colonoscopist, regardless of specialty, makes measurements to establish that their examinations are effective. It is very reasonable and appropriate for patients to ask questions of their colonoscopist about whether quality measurements are being made and their results.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/questions-and-answers-about-quality-in-colonoscopy/" class="faqquestion">How can I be sure that I will receive a careful examination of my colon?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The measurement that best reflects how carefully colonoscopy is performed is a doctorâs "adenoma detection rate." This rate is defined as the percentage of patients age 50 and older undergoing screening colonoscopy, who have one or more precancerous polyps detected. This rate should be at least 25% in men and 15% in women. A secondary measure of careful examination is that doctors should have an average withdrawal time of at least six minutes. The withdrawal time is the time it takes to remove the scope from the colon. This interval is important because this is the phase of colonoscopy when most doctors actually examine the colon systematically for polyps. It is perfectly reasonable to expect doctors to have measured their adenoma detection rate and to record their withdrawal time. It is also reasonable to ask for a copy of the colonoscopy report that documents that the colonoscope was advanced to the very beginning of the colon and that the landmarks of that portion of the colon (called the "cecum") have been documented by notation in the report and by photography.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/questions-and-answers-about-quality-in-colonoscopy/" class="faqquestion">Why is bowel preparation for colonoscopy important, and what can I do to make sure my colon is thoroughly cleansed for the procedure?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Colonoscopy is a video examination of the colon. The video camera and the colonoscope, like any other video camera, cannot see through solids. Therefore, the colon must be thoroughly cleansed to provide the doctor the best opportunity possible for a thorough and detailed examination.Be sure to pick up and read your written bowel preparation instructions at least several days before your colonoscopy. Go over the instructions and make sure you have all of the materials needed to complete the preparation.The most effective bowel preparations involve "split" dosing of the laxatives, in which half of the preparation is taken on the morning of the examination, usually 4 to 5 hours before the time of the scheduled colonoscopy, and completed at least 2 to 3 hours before that time. If you are scheduled at 7 or 8 in the morning, this will mean getting up very early to take the second half of the preparation. If the instructions call for split dosing, do not alter the timing of the doses. It is worth the inconvenience of getting up in the middle of the night to make sure that you have a very effective preparation. The timing of the second dose in relationship to the colonoscopy is critical. If too long an interval is allowed between the end of the second half of the preparation and the timing of the colonoscopy, mucus and secretions will come out of the small intestine and stick to the cecum and right colon.
</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>To ensure an effective and safe colonoscopic examination, find a well-trained colonoscopist who is committed to making quality measurements. It is fair to ask the colonoscopist to be sure to do a slow and careful examination and to provide a copy of the report that documents and photographs the complete extent of examination. Take the bowel preparation instructions seriously. Pick up the written instructions early, read them early, and follow them carefully. When colonoscopy is done carefully and with an effective preparation, it is a very powerful cancer prevention technique.

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/your-doctor-has-ordered-a-colonoscopy-what-questions-should-you-ask/" class="faqquestion">Is the doctor performing your colonoscopy a Gastroenterologist?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>A Gastroenterologist is a specialist in gastrointestinal diseases and has received special training in colonoscopy. Gastroenterologists perform more colonoscopies by far than any other specialty. Non-gastroenterologists are five times more likely to miss colorectal cancer during colonoscopy than Gastroenterologists.<sup>1</sup></p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/your-doctor-has-ordered-a-colonoscopy-what-questions-should-you-ask/" class="faqquestion">What training in colonoscopy did the doctor receive?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Proper training in colonoscopy is necessary not only to increase the chance that the procedure can be completed and any necessary treatments applied, but also to be sure that abnormal results can be properly interpreted. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommends that persons performing colonoscopy complete a fellowship program in gastroenterology or receive training in colonoscopy during a surgical residency.

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Many Gastroenterologists have performed many thousands of colonoscopies. A colonoscopist should know the rate at which their procedures have been associated with a perforation or making a hole in the colon. This rate should certainly be below 1 in 500 examinations and many experts have rates of perforation well below 1 in 1000.

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/your-doctor-has-ordered-a-colonoscopy-what-questions-should-you-ask/" class="faqquestion">How often does your doctor complete the colonoscopy?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Experienced colonoscopists reach the very beginning of the large intestine (the cecum) in more than 90% of cases and in more than 95% of patients who are undergoing screening. Screening is the process of checking people who have no symptoms for colon polyps and cancer.

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/your-doctor-has-ordered-a-colonoscopy-what-questions-should-you-ask/" class="faqquestion">Can the doctor remove polyps from your colon?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Persons performing colonoscopy must be trained in the removal of polyps. Although even Gastroenterologists may refer a patient with a large polyp to a special expert in the removal of polyps, a trained colonoscopist can remove the overwhelming majority of routine polyps.

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/what-is-a-gastroenterologist/" class="faqquestion">What is a Gastroenterologist?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>A Gastroenterologist is a physician with dedicated training management of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and liver.
</p>
</div>
</li> 
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/what-is-a-gastroenterologist/" class="faqquestion">What is Gastroenterology?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Gastroenterology is the study of the normal function and diseases of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon and rectum, pancreas, gallbladder, bile ducts and liver. It involves a detailed understanding of the normal action (physiology) of the gastrointestinal organs including the movement of material through the stomach and intestine (motility), the digestion and absorption of nutrients into the body, removal of waste from the system, and the function of the liver as a digestive organ. It includes common and important conditions such as colon polyps and cancer, hepatitis, gastroesophageal reflux (heartburn), peptic ulcer disease, colitis, gallbladder and biliary tract disease, nutritional problems, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), and pancreatitis. In essence, all normal activity and disease of the digestive organs is part of the study of Gastroenterology.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/what-is-a-gastroenterologist/" class="faqquestion">Training</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>A Gastroenterologist must first complete a three-year Internal Medicine residency and is then eligible for additional specialized training (fellowship) in Gastroenterology. This fellowship is generally 2-3 years long so by the time Gastroenterologists have completed their training, they have had 5-6 years of additional specialized education following medical school.</p>
<p>Gastroenterology fellowship training is an intense, rigorous program where future Gastroenterologists learn directly from nationally recognized experts in the field and develop a detailed understanding of gastrointestinal diseases. They learn how to evaluate patients with gastrointestinal complaints, treat a broad range of conditions, and provide recommendations to maintain health and prevent disease. They learn to care for patients in the office as well as in the hospital.</p>
<p>Gastroenterologists also receive dedicated training in endoscopy (upper endoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy) by expert instructors. Endoscopy is the use of narrow, flexible lighted tubes with built-in video cameras, to visualize the inside of the intestinal tract. This specialized training includes detailed and intensive study of how and when to perform endoscopy, optimal methods to complete these tests safely and effectively, and the use of sedating medications to ensure the comfort and safety of patients. Gastroenterology trainees also learn how to perform advanced endoscopic procedures such as polypectomy (removalof colon polyps), esophageal and intestinal dilation (stretching of narrowed areas), and hemostasis (injection or cautery to stop bleeding). Importantly, Gastroenterologists learn how to properly interpret the findings and biopsy results of these studies in order to make appropriate recommendations to treat conditions and/or prevent cancer. Some Gastroenterologists also receive directed training in advanced procedures using endoscopes such as endoscopic biliary examination (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or ERCP), removal of tumors without surgery (endoscopic mucosal resection or EMR), placement of internal drainage tubes (stents) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). This provides them with the training necessary to non-surgically remove stones in the bile ducts, evaluate and treat tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and liver, and provide minimally invasive alternatives to surgery for some patients.</p>
<p>The most critical emphasis during the training period is attention to detail and incorporation of their comprehensive knowledge of the entire gastrointestinal tract to provide the highest quality endoscopy and consultative services. The final product is a highly trained specialist with a unique combination of broad scientific knowledge, general Internal Medicine training, superior endoscopic skills and experience, and the ability to integrate these elements to provide optimal health care for patients.</p>
<p>This advanced fellowship training is overseen by national societies committed to ensuring high quality and uniform education. These groups include the American Board of Internal Medicine, the American College of Gastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. These groups carefully scrutinize the educational experience of each program to ensure that every Gastroenterology trainee receives the highest quality training. Once fellows successfully complete their training they are considered âBoard Eligible.â They are then qualified to take the Gastroenterology board certification test administered by the American Board of Internal Medicine. Once they have successfully completed this examination they are âBoard Certified.â</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/what-is-a-gastroenterologist/" class="faqquestion">FACG, FACP â What do all the letters after your doctor's name mean?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Some Gastroenterologists receive special recognition from national societies when they demonstrate extraordinary achievement in research, teaching, or other unique service to the field of Gastroenterology. The American College of Gastroenterology and the American College of Physicians designate such physicians as âFellowsâ and the suffixes FACG and FACP are added to denote these honors. This means that these physicians have fulfilled the respective organizationsâ rigorous requirements to gain this added distinction.
</p>
</div>
</li> 
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/what-is-a-gastroenterologist/" class="faqquestion">What makes Gastroenterologists different?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The unique training that Gastroenterologists complete provides them with the ability to provide high quality, comprehensive care for patients with a wide variety of gastrointestinal ailments. Gastroenterologists perform the bulk of research involving gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures as well as the interpretation of results, and are considered experts in the field. Studies have shown that Gastroenterologists perform higher quality colonoscopy examinations and comprehensive consultative services when compared to other physicians. This translates into more accurate detection of polyps and cancer by colonoscopy when performed by Gastroenterologists, fewer complications from procedures and fewer days in the hospital for many gastrointestinal conditions managed by trained gastroenterology specialists. It is this ability to provide more complete, accurate, and thorough care for patients with gastrointestinal conditions, which distinguishes Gastroenterologists from other physicians that provide some similar services.

<p>The hepatitis C virus is the most common cause of chronic viral liver disease in the United States. It is estimated that 1.8% of the U.S. population or about 4 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C. Infection is most prevalent among those born between 1945â1965, the majority of whom were likely infected during the 1970s and 1980s when rates were highest. The CDC estimates that there are 30,000 new acute cases of hepatitis C each year. <a class="more tabselector" href="#" rel="#tabs2">Learn more</a></p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Approximately 20%â30% of those newly infected with HCV experience fatigue, abdominal pain, poor appetite, or jaundice. In those persons who do develop symptoms, the average time period from exposure to symptom onset is 4â12 weeks (range: 2â24 weeks). The majority of people with chronic hepatitis C have no symptoms of liver disease. People with chronic hepatitis C may complain of abdominal pain, fatigue, itching or nausea. Once the patient develops cirrhosis, signs and symptoms may be more prominent. These symptoms might include jaundice, muscle weakness, nausea, weight loss, abdominal swelling, vomiting blood, blood in stool, and confusion.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">Can hepatitis C affect other organs?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>A small percentage of persons with chronic HCV infection develop medical conditions due to hepatitis C that are not limited to the liver. These conditions are thought to be attributable to the bodyâs immune response to HCV infection. Such conditions can include diabetes mellitus, which occurs three times more frequently in HCV-infected persons; glomerulonephritis, a type of kidney disease caused by inflammation of the kidney; essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, a condition involving the presence of abnormal proteins in the blood; porphyria cutanea tarda, an abnormality in heme production that causes skin fragility and blistering and; non-Hodgkins lymphoma, which might occur somewhat more frequently in HCV-infected persons.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">Who gets hepatitis C infection?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
Hepatitis C is spread primarily by contact with blood and blood products. The use of injection illicit drugsis the most common mode of disease transmission including those people who injected illicit drugs onlyone time many years ago. People who received blood transfusions, transfusion of blood products or organ donations prior to 1992, when sensitive tests for HCV were introduced for blood screening, are at risk for hepatitis C infection, as are persons who received clotting factors prior to 1987.Other persons at risk for hepatitis C include long-term kidney dialysis patients, people with tattoos and body piercing other than pierced ears, health care workers after exposures (i.e., needle stick or splashes to the eye) from the blood of an infected person while on the job, infants born to HCV-infected mothers, people with high-risk sexual behavior, multiple partners and sexually transmitted diseases, people who snort cocaine using shared equipment, and people who have shared toothbrushes, razors and other personal items with a family member who is HCV-infected.

After a needlestick or sharps exposure to HCV-positive blood, the risk of HCV infection is approximately 1.8% (range: 0%â10%).
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">Other than needlesticks, do other exposures, such as splashes to the eye, pose a risk to healthcarepersonnel for HCV transmission?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
Although a few cases of HCV transmission via blood splash to the eye have been reported, the risk forsuch transmission is expected to be very low. Avoiding occupational exposure to blood is the primaryway to prevent transmission of bloodborne illnesses among healthcare personnel. All healthcare personnel should adhere to Standard Precautions. Depending on the medical procedure involved, Standard Precautions may include the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, masks, and protective eyewear).
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">Should HCV-infected healthcare personnel be restricted in their work?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
There are no CDC recommendations to restrict a healthcare worker who is infected with HCV. The riskof transmission from an infected healthcare worker to a patient appears to be very low. All healthcarepersonnel, including those who are HCV positive, should follow strict aseptic technique and StandardPrecautions, including appropriate hand hygiene, use of protective barriers, and safe injection practices.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">What is the risk that an HCV-infected mother will spread HCV to her infant during birth?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
Approximately 4 of every 100 infants born to HCV infected mothers become infected with the virus.Transmission can occur at the time of birth, and no procedures are available to reduce this risk. The riskis increased by the presence of high levels of hepatitis C virus in the mother at delivery and also is2â3 times greater if the woman is co-infected with HIV. Most infants infected with HCV at birth have no symptoms and do well during childhood. More research is needed to find out the long-term effects of perinatal HCV infection.<a name="basics_3"></a>

<div class="faqanswer">
At present time, a hepatitis C vaccine is not available.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">What precautions can I take in order to avoid transmitting HCV?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
People who have hepatitis C should remain aware that their blood is potentially infectious. People with hepatitis C should avoid the use of intravenous drugs. Household items such as razors or toothbrushes should not be shared. The hepatitis C virus can be infectious for up to 16 hours outside the body. If you are a health care or public safety worker, always follow routine barrier precautions and safely handle needles and other sharps; get vaccinated against hepatitis B. Consider the risks if you are thinking about getting a tattoo or body piercing. You might infect others if you share the needles or piercing equipment.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">Is hepatitis C sexually transmitted?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
HCV can be spread by sex, but this is rare, accounting for less than 1% of overall cases. Sexual transmission is more common in men having sex with men. If you are having sex with more than one steady sex partner, use latex condoms correctly and every time to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">Should pregnant women be routinely tested for hepatitis C?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
No. Since pregnant women have no greater risk of being infected with HCV than non-pregnant women and interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission are lacking, routine testing of pregnant women for hepatitis C is not recommended. Pregnant women should be tested for hepatitis C only if they have risk factors for HCV infection.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">Should a woman with HCV infection be advised against breastfeeding?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
No. There is no evidence that breastfeeding spreads HCV. However, HCV-positive mothers should consider abstaining from breastfeeding if their nipples are cracked or bleeding.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">Should HCV-infected persons be restricted from working in certain occupations or settings?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
The CDCâs current recommendations for prevention and control of HCV infection specify that persons should not be excluded from work, school, play, child care, or other settings on the basis of their HCV infection status. There is no evidence of HCV transmission from food handlers, teachers, or other service providers in the absence of blood-to-blood contact.<a name="basics_4"></a>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<ul><li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">What are the initial tests used to detect hepatitis C infection?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
Several blood tests are performed to test for HCV infection. Screening tests include hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA).
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">How soon after exposure can the virus be detected?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
HCV infection can be detected by anti-HCV screening tests (enzyme immunoassay) 4â10 weeks after infection. Anti-HCV can be detected in &gt;97% of persons by 6 months after exposure.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">How is the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C confirmed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
Following a positive hepatitis C antibody test, the presence of hepatitis C infection is confirmed by hepatitis C viral load testing. Qualitative or quantitative viral load testing (HCV-RNA by PCR) may be used to detect the presence of hepatitis C in the blood.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">How soon after exposure can the virus be detected?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
The virus appears in blood and can be detected as early as 2â3 weeks after infection.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">When should children born to HCV-infected mothers be tested to see if they were infected at birth?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
Children should be tested for hepatitis C no sooner than age 18 months because hepatitis C antibodiesfrom the mother might last until this age. If diagnosis is desired before the child turns 18 months, testingfor HCV RNA could be performed at or after the infantâs first well-child visit at age 1â2 months. HCVRNA testing should then be repeated at a subsequent visit, independent of the initial HCV RNA test result.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">Under what circumstances is a false-positive anti-HCV test result likely?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
False-positive anti-HCV tests appear more often when persons at low risk for HCV infection (e.g., blood donors) are tested. Therefore, it is important to confirm a positive anti-HCV test with a supplemental test, such as RIBA (recombinant immunoblot assay), as most false positive anti-HCV tests are reported as negative on supplemental testing.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">Under what circumstance is a false-negative anti-HCV test result likely?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
Persons with early HCV infection might not yet have developed antibody levels high enough that the testcan measure. In addition, some persons might lack the immune response necessary for the test to workwell. In these persons, further testing to detect the presence of the virus in blood may be considered.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">What is the significance of the level of virus in the serum (viral load)?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
Hepatitis C viral load does not correlate with disease progression or with degree of inflammation or fibrosis seen on liver biopsy. Patients with high viral loads are less likely to respond to currently approved antiviral treatment regimens.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">What is the significance of genotype testing?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
There are six known genotypes and more than 90 subtypes of hepatitis C. Knowing the genotype can help predict the likelihood of treatment response and, in many cases, determine the duration of treatment. The most common genotype seen in the United States is genotype 1. Genotype is not associated with disease progression but is associated with varying response to current antiviral therapies. Patients with genotype 2 or 3 have higher sustained viral response rates to pegylatedinterferon and ribavirin therapy than those with genotypes 1 or 4. There is little published informationon the treatment of genotypes 5 or 6. Once the genotype is identified, it need not be tested again; genotypes do not change during the course of infection.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">Can infection with more than one genotype of HCV occur?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
Infection is possible if risk behaviors for HCV infection continue, but it is believed to be very uncommon.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">What do the liver enzymes indicate?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
The liver enzymes (ALT and AST) may be elevated in chronic hepatitis C infection. ALT in HCV is not correlated with disease progression or underlying histology. Many patients with chronic hepatitis C have normal ALT levels. It is common for patients with chronic Hepatitis C to have liver enzyme levels that go up and down, with periodic returns to normal or near normal levels. Liver enzyme levels can remain normal for over a year despite chronic liver disease.
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">Why do I need to have a liver biopsy?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
A liver biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis. Liver biopsy is helpful for grading the severity of inflammation, staging the amount of fibrosis and determining the presence of cirrhosis and determining the degree of fatty infiltration of the liver. Liver biopsy is the best test to determine how damaged the liver is.

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">How common is the hepatitis C virus?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The hepatitis C virus is the most common cause of chronic viral liver disease in the United States. It is estimated that 1.8% of the U.S. population or about 4 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C. Infection is most prevalent among those born between 1945â1965, the majority of whom were likely infected during the 1970s and 1980s when rates were highest. The CDC estimates that there are 30,000 new acute cases of hepatitis C each year.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">How many patients with hepatitis C develop cirrhosis?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>It is estimated that nearly 20% of patients with chronic hepatitis C will develop cirrhosis over a period of decades. Factors which influence progression to cirrhosis include co-infection with hepatitis B or the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), alcohol use and obesity.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">Who gets hepatitis C infection?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Hepatitis C is spread primarily by contact with blood and blood products. The use of injection illicit drugs is the most common mode of disease transmission including those people who injected illicit drugs only one time many years ago. People who received blood transfusions, transfusion of blood products or organ donations prior to 1992, when sensitive tests for HCV were introduced for blood screening, are at risk for hepatitis C infection, as are persons who received clotting factors prior to 1987. Other persons at risk for hepatitis C include long-term kidney dialysis patients, people with tattoos and body piercing other than pierced ears, health care workers after exposures (i.e., needle stick or splashes to the eye) from the blood of an infected person while on the job, infants born to HCV-infected mothers, people with high-risk sexual behavior, multiple partners and sexually transmitted diseases, people who snort cocaine using shared equipment, and people who have shared toothbrushes, razors and other personal items with a family member who is HCV-infected.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">What are the signs and symptoms of hepatitis C?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Approximately 20%â30% of those newly infected with HCV experience fatigue, abdominal pain, poor appetite, or jaundice. In those persons who do develop symptoms, the average time period from exposure to symptom onset is 4â12 weeks (range: 2â24 weeks).The majority of people with chronic hepatitis C have no symptoms of liver disease. People with chronic hepatitis C may complain of abdominal pain, fatigue, itching or nausea. Once the patient develops cirrhosis, signs and symptoms may be more prominent. These symptoms might include jaundice, muscle weakness, nausea, weight loss, abdominal swelling, vomiting blood, blood in stool, and confusion.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">Can hepatitis C affect other organs?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>A small percentage of persons with chronic HCV infection develop medical conditions due to hepatitis C that are not limited to the liver. These conditions are thought to be attributable to the body's immune response to HCV infection. Such conditions can include diabetes mellitus, which occurs three times more frequently in HCV-infected persons; glomerulonephritis, a type of kidney disease caused by inflammation of the kidney; essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, a condition involving the presence of abnormal proteins in the blood; porphyria catenae tarda, an abnormality in heme production that causes skin fragility and blistering and; non-Hodgkins lymphoma, which might occur somewhat more frequently in HCV-infected persons.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hepatitis-c/" class="faqquestion">Other than needle sticks, do other exposures, such as splashes to the eye, pose a risk to healthcare personnel for HCV transmission?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Although a few cases of HCV transmission via blood splash to the eye have been reported, the risk for such transmission is expected to be very low. Avoiding occupational exposure to blood is the primary way to prevent transmission of blood borne illnesses among healthcare personnel. All healthcare personnel should adhere to Standard Precautions. Depending on the medical procedure involved, Standard Precautions may include the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, masks, and protective eyewear).</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">What is the difference between Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two types of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The large intestine (colon) is inflamed in ulcerative colitis, and this involves the inner lining of the colon. In Crohn's disease the inflammation extends deeper into the intestinal wall. Crohn's disease can also involve the small intestine (ileitis), or can involve both the small and large intestine (ileocolitis).</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">How is IBD different from Irritable Bowel Syndrome?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>IBD develops due to inflammation in the intestine which can result in bleeding, fever, elevation of the white blood cell count, as well as diarrhea and cramping abdominal pain. The abnormalities in IBD can usually be visualized by cross-sectional imaging (for instance a CT scan) or colonoscopy. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a set of symptoms resulting from disordered sensation or abnormal function of the small and large bowel. Irritable Bowel Syndrome is characterized by crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or constipation, but is not accompanied by fever, bleeding or an elevated white blood cell count. Examination by colonoscopy or barium x-ray reveals no abnormal findings.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">What is the cause of IBD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There is no single explanation for the development of IBD. A prevailing theory holds that a process, possibly viral, bacterial, or allergic, initially inflames the small or large intestine and, depending on genetic predisposition, results in the development of antibodies which chronically "attack" the intestine, leading to inflammation. Approximately 10 percent of patients with IBD have a close family member (parent, sibling or child) with the disease, which lends support to a genetic predisposition in some patients.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">Is IBD caused by stress?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Emotional stress due to family, job or social pressures may result in worsening of the Irritable Bowel Syndrome but there is little evidence to suggest that stress is a major cause for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Although IBD is not caused by stress recent studies show that there may be a relationship between the two--stressful periods in life may lead to a flare of disease activity in persons with the underlying diagnosis of IBD.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">How is IBD diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There is no single test that can make the diagnosis of IBD or completely rule out its existence reliably. Colonoscopy, cross-sectional imaging studies of the colon or the upper GI tract, along with newer blood tests that detect markers that are commonly associated with IBD, along with a patient's history and physical exam, can all be useful in helping your doctor establish a diagnosis of IBD.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">What are the complications of IBD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease can lead to diarrhea, bleeding, anemia, weight loss, fevers, malnutrition and fistulae. IBD can also have extra-intestinal manifestations where areas other than your gastrointestinal system such as your skeletal system, your skin or your eyes may be involved.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">What medical treatments are available for IBD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Various formulations of 5-ASA, a drug which has been used to treat IBD for over 50 years, are available as oral preparations, suppositories and enemas. These are often one of the first drugs used to treat IBD.</p>
<p>Corticosteroid therapies, such as prednisone or hydrocortisone, are given when the 5-ASA products are insufficient to control inflammation. These drugs can be given orally, rectally as suppositories or enemas, or intravenously.<br>
Drugs which suppress the body's immune response in IBD (known as immunomodulators) are used. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are the two most commonly used immunomodulators for anti-immune therapy.</p>
Finally, a newer class of medications called "biologics" is used for patients with moderate to severe disease. Biologics include medications like infliximab (RemicadeÂ®), a medication given thru an IV infusion, and adalimumab (HumiraÂ®) and certolizumab pegol (CimziaÂ®), medications given via subcutaneous injection. </div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">Are there complications from the medical treatments?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Sulfasalazine, a 5-ASA product first used to treat IBD in the 1940s, may cause nausea, indigestion or headache in about 15 percent of patients and worsening diarrhea in about 4 percent of patients. The newer drugs have fewer side effects. Chronic corticosteroid therapy can lead to fluid retention and high blood pressure, some rounding of the face and softening of the bones similar to osteoporosis. These complications usually prompt attempts to discontinue corticosteroid treatment as soon as possible. The anti-immune drugs require periodic monitoring of the blood count since some patients will develop a low white blood cell count. These drugs, however, are usually well-tolerated in many patients. Biologics can alter a patient's ability to respond to any stressors to their immune system and in some patients may make it harder for their body to fight off infections.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">Is diet management important for patients with IBD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Physicians prefer to maintain good nutrition for those diagnosed with IBD. If you are responding well to medical management you can often eat a reasonably unrestricted diet. A low-roughage diet is often suggested for those prone to diarrhea after meals. If you appear to be milk sensitive (lactose intolerant), you are advised to either avoid milk products or use milk to which the enzyme lactase has been added.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">How successful is medical therapy?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>With early and proper treatment the majority of patients with IBD lead healthy and productive lives. Some patients may require surgery for treatment of complications of IBD such as an abscess, bowel obstruction or inadequate response to treatment.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">What are surgical options for IBD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Crohn's disease of the small or large intestine can be treated surgically for complications such as obstruction, abscess, fistula or failure to respond adequately to treatment. The disease may recur at some time after the operation.</p>
Ulcerative colitis is curable with removal of the entire colon. This may require creating an "ileostomy" (with attachment of the ileum to the external abdominal wall with an external application pouch) or may involve the direct attachment of the small intestine (ileum) to the anus. This type of surgery, known as "IPAA surgery," does not require an external application pouch </div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_2" class="faqquestion">What is Crohn's Disease?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Crohn's disease (CD) belongs to a group of diseases collectively called Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) which also includes Ulcerative Colitis (UC). It is a chronic disease that can cause inflammation anywhere from the mouth to the anus anywhere along the lining of the digestive tract. It most commonly affects the small intestine and the colon. The disease can show up along different parts of the digestive tract in a continuous or patchy distribution. It typically involves both the superficial and deep layers of the intestinal wall</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_2" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of CD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Symptoms of CD depend on the severity and location of the intestinal inflammation and can range from none or mild, to severe. Symptoms may develop gradually or come on suddenly, without warning. Abdominal pain and cramping, persistent diarrhea (loose, watery, numerous bowel movements), blood in the stool and fever are hallmark symptoms of CD. Ulcers of the mouth, a lack of appetite, fatigue, nausea and vomiting and unexplained weight loss may also develop. With severe diarrhea and the digestive tracks' inability to absorb nutrients, nutritional deficiencies may occur over time</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>We do not yet know an exact cause of CD. Similar to other chronic inflammatory disorders (e.g. asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis) there is a complex interaction between an individual's genetic make-up, their immune system and foreign substances in the environment (including dietary factors and microbes living in our gut) that are responsible for the chronic uncontrolled inflammation in CD. The impact of the various factors (genes, immune system and environment) are different for each individual accounting for the broad spectrum of how patients present with inflammation in different segments of the intestine and in various degrees of severity. Unfortunately, it appears as if once this inflammatory process is set in motion it cannot be regulated or reversed by the body itself</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_2" class="faqquestion">Who gets CD and how common is it? </a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>CD affects about 500,000 Americans. Men and women appear to be affected equally. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 15-35 but can develop at any time during one's lifetime. It used to be thought that CD predominantly affects Caucasians in North America and Western Europe, however, we now see individuals being diagnosed with CD in populations from South America, Africa and Asia where the disease was unheard of 20 years ago.</p>

<p>CD can run in families and having a sibling or another first degree relative afflicted with the disease can increase the risk of developing the disease by ten to fifteen times as compared to the general population. Some important genetic mutations have been identified in this disease including the NOD2/CARD 15 genes. However, more than 80% of patients with CD do not have a recognized genetic disposition. Given the complex genetic makeup the disease it is not inherited in the classic sense.</p>

<p>Smoking is an important controllable risk factor in CD. People who smoke with this disease tend to have more severe forms of the disease and are at higher risk of needing surgery. People who live in industrialized countries and urban areas are also at elevated risk of having the disease. Some other factors including the use of medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin-like drugs) and particular infections have been theorized to exacerbate or cause the disease although none have been shown in a consistent fashion to be the cause</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_2" class="faqquestion">How is CD diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There is no single test to confirm the diagnosis of CD. Instead, multiple tests are usually used in combination to help arrive at the diagnosis depending on the symptoms that lead individuals to seek care. Ultimately, a colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy must be performed to directly visualize the intestine internally and to obtain small tissue samples (biopsies) for evaluation under the microscope. Other imagines studies can be used in conjunction with a colonoscopy to help in the evaluation including a barium enema, upper gastrointestinal series (UGI series) with small bowel follow through, computerized tomography scans (CT scans or 'cat scans'), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a pill camera study (capsule endoscopy) but are not mandated. Blood tests which look for antibodies and markers of inflammation along with stool specimen tests for hidden blood and infection may also be used to help confirm or exclude the diagnosis of CD</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_2" class="faqquestion">What complications should I watch out for in CD? </a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>CD may cause symptoms outside the digestive tract including: inflammation of the eye (conjunctivitis, episcleritis, uveitis, iritis), inflammation of joints (arthritis), weakening of bones (osteoporosis), skin rashes (erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum), inflammation of the liver or bile ducts (primary sclerosing cholangitis), kidney stones, gallstones and in children, delayed growth or sexual development due to the use of steroids, malnutrition and malabsorption.

Crohn's disease may also lead to several complications over time which may be related to the disease or due to the effects of medications used to treat the disease. Listed below are some of the common complications:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Anal fissure.</strong> A crack, or cleft, in or around the skin of the anus which lead to painful bowel movements, blood in the stool and sometimes drainage around the anal canal.</li>

	<li><strong>Ulcers.</strong> Chronic inflammation can lead to open sores (ulcers) anywhere in the digestive tract, including the mouth, genital area (perineum) and anus.</li>


	<li><strong>Fistulas.</strong> Sometimes ulcers can extend completely through the intestinal wall, creating a fistula â an abnormal tunnel between different parts of the intestine, between the intestine and skin or other organs, such as the bladder or vagina. These abnormal connections affect up to a third of patients with CD. Internal connections lead to diversion of food contents while external connections can lead to drainage and infections. When a course of medical therapy fails, surgery may be necessary to fix these abnormal connections.</li>


	<li><strong>Bowel obstruction.</strong> Due to inflammation over time, parts of the bowel could form scar tissue resulting in a thickening and narrowing of the bowel, which may block the flow of digestive contents through the affected part of the intestine. Medications may be of help in decreasing the inflammation and opening up the narrowed areas but some cases require surgery to remove the disesed portion of the bowel.</li>


	<li><strong>Malnutrition.</strong> Symptoms of diarrhea, pain and cramping may make it difficult to eat. In addition, inflammation of the intestine can decrease absorption of vital nutrients needed to maintain nourishment. Deficiencies of proteins, calories and vitamins may occur over a prolonged period of time. Vitamin B-12 and iron deficiency frequently lead to anemia in patients with malnutrition.</li>

	<li><strong>Colon cancer.</strong> Patients with Crohn's disease that involves the colon do have an increased risk of colon cancer depending upon the amount of the colon that is affected and the duration of disease. Less than 5% of patients develop colon cancer although this is higher than the general population. Therefore, after approximately 8 years from the start of symptoms a colonoscopy is performed every 1 to 2 years to look for precancerous changes called dysplasia. Identifying dysplasia allows the potential to remove dysplastic growths (polyps) prior to the development of cancer.</li>
</ol>

</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_2" class="faqquestion">What are different types of treatment for CD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Currently, there is no cure for CD and the goal of treatment is to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and improve quality of life. This can be achieved through suppression of the body's immune response which is paramount to allow the intestinal tissue to heal and retain its normal function. Initially, the goal is to induce remission, which is to bring the symptoms under control. Once this step is achieved, medical therapy is used to maintain remission with the goal of decreasing the frequency of disease flares. Several groups of drugs are used to treat Crohn's disease and are listed below:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong><em>Aminosalicylates (5-ASA):</em></strong> This class of anti-inflammatory drugs is often used to treat mild to moderate symptoms in the colon and includes oral formulations of sulfasalazine and mesalamine (Apriso<sup>Â®</sup>, Asacol<sup>Â®</sup>, Colazal<sup>Â®</sup>, Dipentum<sup>Â®</sup>, Pentasa<sup>Â®</sup>, or Lialda<sup>Â®</sup>) and drugs that may be administered rectally (Canasa<sup>Â®</sup> or Rowasa<sup>Â®</sup>).</li>

	<li><strong><em>Corticosteroids:</em></strong> This class of medications has a general, nonspecific effect of suppressing the entire immune system and is used to treat moderate to severe forms of the disease. Prednisone, budesonide and methylprednisolone are most commonly used. These are drugs that are best utilized short-term to alleviate major flares of the disease and due to side effects, these should not be used for maintenance therapy. Owing to a significantly increased risk of osteoporosis with the use of corticosteroids, a baseline DEXA scan should be performed at the initiation of therapy. Supplementation of calcium and vitamin D, and consideration of a bisphosphonate are also warranted.</li>

	<li><strong><em>Immune modifiers</em></strong>: Azathioprine (Imuran<sup>Â®</sup>), 6-MP (Purinethol<sup>Â®</sup>), cyclosporine A and methotrexate alter the immune system and are also referred to as <em>immunomodulators</em>, used to help decrease exposure to corticosteroids, maintain disease remission and to help heal fistulas.</li>

	<li><strong><em>Antibiotics</em></strong>: These are classically used to treat perianal disease, abscesses and sometimes acute flares of the disease. Metronidazole and ciprofloxacin are the most commonly used.</li>

	<li><strong><em>Biologic therapies.</em></strong> This newer group of medications was first approved in 1998 for moderate to severe CD that did not respond to conventional therapy or to treat fistulae. These medications work by blocking specific chemical messages between immune cells. Infliximab (Remicade<sup>Â®</sup>) was the first biologic therapy to treat inflammatory bowel disease and since 2007, adalimumab (Humira<sup>Â®</sup>), Natalizumab (Tysabri<sup>Â®</sup>) and Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia<sup>Â®</sup>) have all been approved by the FDA to treat patients with CD. These medications primarily differ in their composition and schedule of administration. They are all given through infusion or injection therapy. These medications are more costly than conventional agents and also suppress the immune system leading to a small, but significant increased risk of infections and, rarely, to lymphomas.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_2" class="faqquestion">Is there a role for surgery in CD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Surgery does not cure CD but is currently required at some point in the course of a majority of patients (up to 80%) with CD over their lifetime. Common indications for surgery include presence of an intestinal obstruction, formation of an abscess or fistula. Surgery also becomes necessary in CD when medications can no longer control the symptoms. Usually, the severely affected part of the intestine is removed and the two ends are reconnected. If there is extensive disease of the colon in CD, the entire colon may be removed and an end-ileostomy (end of the small intestine attached to the skin with an external bag to collect the contents) may be performed. The overall goal of surgery in CD is to conserve bowel and maintain the best possible quality of life. Most patients who require surgery will have marked improvements in their symptoms, reduction in their medications and an improvement in their quality of life</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_2" class="faqquestion">What is the clinical course and prognosis in CD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Most people with CD with the proper medical care tend to live healthy, productive lives with a normal life span. Maintenance of remission and surveillance for complications are the major goals which lead to maintaining quality of life in patients with CD. Regular visits with a gastroenterologist and developing a longstanding relationship are vital to managing this disease</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_2" class="faqquestion">Can women with CD have children?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>A healthy pregnancy, childbirth and baby are possible in women with CD. Well controlled CD does not increase the risk of miscarriages, stillbirths or congenital abnormalities. The goal during pregnancy is to prevent and treat flares aggressively to decrease any increased risk to the fetus during a flare</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_2" class="faqquestion">What can I do to improve my health in CD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Diet, nutrition, stress and lifestyle modifications can all lead to improved quality of life in patients with CD. Unfortunately, there is no single diet that is appropriate for all patients with CD and dietary advice will depend upon the location of intestinal inflammation and the associated symptoms. There is no factor in the diet that we know causes inflammation, but dietary components can certainly cause or worsen symptoms. Healthy diets (avoiding fatty and fried foods), and adequate intake of protein improve symptoms and maintain nutrition. Some patients will not tolerate milk products (containing the milk sugar â lactose) or other concentrated sugars such as fructose (corn syrup). Taking multivitamins and speaking to a dietician also can be of great benefit. Exercise and stress management can decrease flares and help moderate the disease. Smoking should be stopped by all who have CD or are at increased risk of developing CD. A group of medications, known as NSAIDS (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen), should also be avoided as they can worsen CD in some patients</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_2" class="faqquestion">What are the chances my child will have CD if I do?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Children who have one parent with CD have approximately a 7-10% lifetime risk of developing this disease. If both parents have the disease then the lifetime risk increases to 35%</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_2" class="faqquestion">Do complementary and alternative therapies work in CD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Many alternative therapies have been tried in CD due to either the lack of effectiveness of primary medical therapies or side effects of common therapies. Acupuncture, hypnosis, herbal supplements, fish oil, probiotics and other home remedies have been reported. Unfortunately, most of these remedies have shown no significant benefit, have never been rigorously studied and are not regulated by the FDA</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_2" class="faqquestion">Where can I get more information on CD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Many organizations exist which provide support and information for patients with CD. The ACG Web site has additional information. The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (<a href="http://www.ccfa.org" target="_blank">www.ccfa.org</a>) has extensive patient information along with links to various different social, financial, and medical support groups. Other sources of information include the individual drug company Web sites, and, most importantly, a personal physician.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_3" class="faqquestion">What is Ulcerative Colitis?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disease marked by inflammation of the lining of the colon and rectum, together known as the large intestine. This inflammation causes irritation in the lining of the large intestine which leads to the symptoms of UC. Though UC always affects the lowest part of the large intestine (the rectum), in some patients it can be present throughout the entire colon. UC belongs to a group of diseases called inflammatory bowel diseases which also includes Crohn's disease (CD). Though it was once thought that UC and CD were two different diseases, as many as 10% of patients may have features of both diseases and this is called indeterminate colitis. It is important to note that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is different from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_3" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of UC?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The symptoms of ulcerative colitis depend on the severity of inflammation and the amount of the colon that is affected by the disease. In patients with mild to moderate inflammation, symptoms can include rectal bleeding, diarrhea, mild abdominal cramping, stool urgency, and tenesmus (discomfort and the feeling that you have not completely emptied your rectum after a bowel movement). When more severe inflammation is present, patients often develop fever, dehydration, severe abdominal pain, weight loss, loss of appetite or growth retardation (in children and adolescents with UC). Individuals with moderate or severe inflammation may also have to wake up at night to have bowel movements and may lose control of bowel movements. Some of the symptoms of UC may be non-specific and could be caused by other diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or infection. Your doctor can help determine the cause of your symptoms and should be consulted should you experience a significant change in your symptoms.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_3" class="faqquestion">How is UC diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Your doctor will usually suspect the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis based on your symptoms, but confirmation of the diagnosis requires testing. Blood work is often checked to look for markers of inflammation or anemia (low blood counts), though these tests can be normal in patients with mild disease. Tests of your stool to look for evidence of an intestinal infection are often obtained. Radiologic images including x-rays and CT scans are usually not recommended but may be performed. All patients with symptoms consistent with UC should have a colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy to confirm the diagnosis assuming that they are healthy enough to undergo the procedure. During this procedure, your gastroenterologist will be able to directly examine the lining of your colon and rectum to look for evidence of inflammation and take small biopsies to be examined under a microscope to look for the cause of the inflammation.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_3" class="faqquestion">What causes UC?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The way in which patients get ulcerative colitis is still poorly understood. There seems to be an interaction between the unique genetic makeup of an individual, environmental factors, and a patient's specific immune system that triggers the disease. UC is not an infection that can be passed from person to person. Men and women are equally affected by UC.</p>

<p>UC is more common in first degree relatives (siblings, parents, and children) of patients affected by UC and up to 20% of patients will have an affected family member. Despite the influence of genetics, the majority of patients with UC do not pass the disease to their children. There is no way to predict those at higher risk. Cases of ulcerative colitis have been identified throughout the world though certain populations, including those living in Northern climates and those of Jewish descent, are at higher risk of developing UC.</p>

<p>Individuals having their appendix removed prior to the age of 20 appear to be at lower risk of developing UC. No specific infectious agent has been linked to UC and diet, breast feeding, and various medications have also been examined but none have been found to cause UC.</p>

<p>It has been observed that smokers have lower rates of UC than non-smokers. Furthermore, those who smoke and have UC tend to have a milder course of UC than those who do not smoke (note that this is the exact opposite effect that smoking has on Crohn's disease). Despite the protective role smoking appears to have on the development and natural history of UC, it is not recommended that patients start smoking to prevent UC due to the fact that there are so many other illnesses and cancers in which smoking is a definite risk factor.</p>

<p>UC is an immune-mediated disease in which there is loss of control of the normal bowel immune activity and the ongoing activity results in damage to the bowel wall.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_3" class="faqquestion">What are the possible complications of UC?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The complications of ulcerative colitis can be divided into those affecting the colon and those occurring outside of the colon. Within the colon, UC can rarely lead to toxic megacolon or colon cancer.</p>

<p>Toxic megacolon describes a severe disease flare with a high risk of infection and colonic perforation (holes in the colon). Patients may occasionally present with toxic megacolon as their initial presentation of UC and this complication requires hospitalization and may lead to surgery to remove the colon (colectomy).</p>

<p>UC is known to increase the risk of colon cancer. Those patients who have had UC for a long time and those with a longer length of the colon affected are at higher risk of developing colon cancer. In general, patients begin to have an increased risk of colorectal cancer 10 years after the onset of disease symptoms and should have colonoscopy every one or two years starting at this time. Colon cancer is a rare complication and it is thought that it may be preventable based on control of inflammation of the colon and careful colonoscopy examinations that look for any pre-cancerous changes called dysplasia. Overall, the risk of colon cancer increases 0.5% yearly after 10 years of disease though patients with inflammation throughout their colon may be at higher risk. Those patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are at greatest risk for colon cancer and need to start screening upon diagnosis.</p>

<p>Patients with UC are also at risk for extra-intestinal manifestations of UC (complications outside of the colon). These complications most frequently involve the liver, skin, eyes, mouth, and joints. Within the liver, patients with UC may develop primary sclerosing cholangitis. This occurs in about 3% of patients with UC. PSC can progress even if UC is not active and it is often detected by elevations in liver blood tests and confirmed by the use of MRI scans such as Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic procedures such as Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).</p>

<p>Patients with UC can develop sores in the mouth or rashes on the skin that generally only appear when UC colon symptoms are active. The most common rashes that are seen in UC are erythema nodosum (EN) and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). EN usually presents as a red, raised, painful area most commonly on the legs and is most often seen during flares of UC. PG also presents as raised lesions on the skin (most frequently on the legs) that often develops after trauma to the skin and can lead to the formation of ulcers. Unlike in EN, the appearance of skin lesions in PG may or may not mirror the activity of bowel symptoms. The eyes can become red and painful (uveitis) and vision problems should be reported to your doctor.</p>

<p>Arthritis is commonly associated with UC and can affect either small (such as the fingers/toes) or large joints (often the knee), though involvement of the smaller joints may have a course that is not related to activity in the colon. The joints of the spine can be affected as well, though this is less common than it is in Crohn's disease.</p>

<p>As in other chronic medical conditions, anxiety and depression are common in patients with UC. The unpredictability of UC and the need to take medications on a daily basis can lead to feelings of frustration or anger. Though occasional feelings of frustration can be normal, feelings of significant anxiety or depression should be brought to the attention of your physician. There are many support opportunities available for those having trouble coping with UC (see the final section).</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_3" class="faqquestion">What is the clinical course of UC?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Ulcerative colitis can present in a variety of ways. UC is often a chronic, life-long condition. It most often is diagnosed in the 2nd and 3rd decades of life (ages 11-30), although it can be diagnosed at any age. The initial presentation can be mild and is sometimes confused with other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or it can be very severe and require hospitalization and surgery. For most patients, UC tends to follow a course marked by periods of disease activity followed by variable periods during which a patient is symptom free. Some patients may have continuous disease activity. Rarely, a patient will have only a single disease flare. In general, those people with a severe first attack of UC and those who have their entire colon affected by UC tend to have a more aggressive course with more frequent flares and shorter periods of remission. Despite the chronic nature of UC, most patients are able to function well and the life expectancy of a patient with UC is normal.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_3" class="faqquestion">How is UC treated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Medical treatment of ulcerative colitis generally focuses on two separate goals: the induction of remission (making a sick person well) and the maintenance of remission (keeping a well person from getting sick again). Surgery is also a treatment option for UC and will be discussed separately. Medication choices can be grouped into four general categories: aminosalicylates, steroids, immunomodulators, and biologics.</p>

<p>Aminosalicylates are a group of anti-inflammatory medications (sulfasalazine, mesalamine, olsalazine, and balsalazide) used for both the induction and maintenance of remission in mild to moderate UC. These medications are available in both oral and rectal formulations and work on the lining of the colon to decrease inflammation. They are generally well tolerated. The most common side effects include nausea and rash. Rectal formulations of mesalamine (enemas and suppositories) are generally used for those patients with disease at the end of their colon.</p>

<p>Steroids (prednisone) are an effective medication for the induction of remission in moderate to severe UC and are available in oral, rectal, and intravenous (IV) forms. Steroids are absorbed into the bloodstream and have a number of severe side effects that make them unsuitable for chronic use to maintain remission. These side effects include cataracts, osteoporosis, mood effects, an increased susceptibility to infection, high blood pressure, weight gain, and an underactive adrenal gland.</p>

<p>Immunomodulators include medications such as 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine. These are taken in pill form and absorbed into the bloodstream. They are effective for maintenance of remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, but are slow to work and can take up to 2-3 months to reach their peak effect. Because of this, these medications are often combined with other medications (such as steroids) in patients who are very ill. These medications require frequent blood work as they can cause liver test abnormalities and low white blood cell counts, both of which are reversible when the medication is stopped. Adverse reactions can include nausea, rash, liver and bone marrow toxicity, pancreatitis, and rarely lymphoma.</p>

<p>Biologic agents are medications given by injection that are used to treat moderate to severe UC. At the current time, infliximab (RemicadeÂ®) is the only biologic agent approved for use in UC, but other biologics used for Crohn's disease under evaluation for the treatment of UC include adalimumab (HumiraÂ®), and certolizumab pegol (CimziaÂ®). Infliximab is effective in both the induction and maintenance of remission in UC. The side effects of this medicine may include an allergic reaction to the medication called an "infusion reaction" or "hypersensitivity reaction". There are also rare risks of serious infections with these medications. Lymphoma is a rare risk of these therapies as well. Combination therapy with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine and biologics increases the risk of a particularly rare type of lymphoma called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. As with all medications, you should discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.</p>

<p>Other medications used less frequently for UC include cyclosporine and tacrolimus. These agents are sometimes used in those rare cases of severe UC that are not responsive to steroids. Side effects of these agents include infections and kidney problems. These agents are offered at a limited number of hospitals and are usually used for a short period of time as a bridge to other maintenance therapies such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine.</p>

<p>No matter which medical therapy you and your doctor decide upon, adherence with the prescribed course is essential. No medical therapy can work if it is not taken and failure to take your medications can lead to unnecessary escalation of therapy if it is not brought to the attention of your doctor. Because many of the complications associated with UC are related to ongoing disease activity, good medication adherence may minimize these risks.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_3" class="faqquestion">What is the role of surgery?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Surgery in ulcerative colitis is performed for a number of reasons and is generally considered to be curative if the entire large intestine removed. Patients who do not respond to medications, are concerned about or have unacceptable side effects from medications, develop toxic megacolon, dysplasia (precancerous lesions) or cancer, or children who are not growing because of UC are often considered for surgery. Several different surgeries are performed for UC and the choice of surgery is dependent on patient preference and the experience of the surgeon. The most common surgery is total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (total removal of the colon and rectum with creation of a pseudo-rectum from a portion of the small intestine). This operation usually requires two separate surgeries to complete although it may require three stages in severely ill patients. Following this surgery, patients can expect 5-10 stools daily as they no longer have a colon to store stool. Patients usually feel better because their sense of stool urgency improves, they no longer have bleeding, and their medications can often be stopped. However, these patients are at risk for post-operative inflammation of the pouch known as pouchitis which is usually treated with antibiotics. Women who have this surgery may have decreased ability to get pregnant naturally.</p>

<p>Another common surgical procedure involves a proctocolectomy with ileostomy (removal of the entire colon and rectum and connection of the small intestine to the abdominal wall so that stool empties into a bag). This procedure is often undertaken in elderly patients, obese patients or those with anal dysfunction. Should you need a surgical procedure for UC, your surgeon can help you decide which type of surgery best fits your needs.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_3" class="faqquestion">Do complementary and alternative therapies work in UC?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Outside of the standard medical therapies discussed for ulcerative colitis, many alternative therapies have been studied. No studies have suggested that diet can either cause or treat UC and there is no specific diet that patients with UC should follow though it is advisable to eat a balanced diet. Likewise, there is no convincing evidence that UC results from food allergies. Though vitamin and mineral deficiencies are more common in Crohn's disease, specific deficiencies can occur in UC patients. For this reason, a multivitamin and a calcium supplement are not unreasonable. Malnutrition can become a concern in severe UC.</p>

<p>Probiotics are species of bacteria that are thought to have beneficial properties for the bowel. There are a number of scientific studies which have been performed to assess the role of probiotics in UC, and most of these have not shown benefit. There is some evidence, however, that a specific probiotic (VSL #3) may be helpful as an additive to other therapies for maintenance of remission.</p>

<p>Various other herbal remedies and alternative therapies have been studied for use in patients with IBD such as curcumin (a derivative of the herb tumeric) and parasitic worms (helminths). Though limited studies have shown promise for a number of alternative therapies, these have not yet been shown to be safe and effective and are not currently recommended. Studies of homeopathic compounds are currently ongoing and will hopefully provide novel treatments for use in UC in the future.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_3" class="faqquestion">What type of follow-up is required?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>As mentioned earlier, ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease and establishing a long term relationship with a gastroenterologist experienced in the treatment of UC is advisable. Many medications used in UC require regular blood work to ensure that they are not causing any serious side effects. Patients with UC have a higher risk of osteoporosis associated with both underlying disease activity and long term or frequent steroid use. Because of this risk, your doctor may recommend measurement of Vitamin D blood levels and a bone mineral density screening with a DEXA scan. Colorectal cancer screening is also important because of the higher risk of cancer in patients with UC as discussed earlier.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/#basics_3" class="faqquestion">Where can you get more information?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Many organizations provide support and information for patients with ulcerative colitis. The ACG Web site has additional information. The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (<a href="http://www.ccfa.org" target="_blank">www.ccfa.org</a>) has extensive patient information along with links to various different social, financial, and medical support groups. Other sources of information include the individual drug company Web sites, and, most importantly, your personal physician.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">What is the difference between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two types of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The large intestine (colon) is inflamed in ulcerative colitis, and this involves the inner lining of the colon. In Crohn's disease the inflammation extends deeper into the intestinal wall. Crohn's disease can also involve the small intestine (ileitis), or can involve both the small and large intestine (ileocolitis).</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">How is IBD different from Irritable Bowel Syndrome?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>IBD develops due to inflammation in the intestine which can result in bleeding, fever, elevation of the white blood cell count, as well as diarrhea and cramping abdominal pain. The abnormalities in IBD can usually be visualized by cross-sectional imaging (for instance a CT scan) or colonoscopy. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a set of symptoms resulting from disordered sensation or abnormal function of the small and large bowel. Irritable Bowel Syndrome is characterized by crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or constipation, but is not accompanied by fever, bleeding or an elevated white blood cell count. Examination by colonoscopy or barium x-ray reveals no abnormal findings.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">What is the cause of IBD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There is no single explanation for the development of IBD. A prevailing theory holds that a process, possibly viral, bacterial, or allergic, initially inflames the small or large intestine and, depending on genetic predisposition, results in the development of antibodies which chronically "attack" the intestine, leading to inflammation. Approximately 10 percent of patients with IBD have a close family member (parent, sibling or child) with the disease, which lends support to a genetic predisposition in some patients.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">Is IBD caused by stress?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Emotional stress due to family, job or social pressures may result in worsening of the Irritable Bowel Syndrome but there is little evidence to suggest that stress is a major cause for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Although IBD is not caused by stress recent studies show that there may be a relationship between the two--stressful periods in life may lead to a flare of disease activity in persons with the underlying diagnosis of IBD.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">How is IBD diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There is no single test that can make the diagnosis of IBD or completely rule out its existence reliably. Colonoscopy, cross-sectional imaging studies of the colon or the upper GI tract, along with newer blood tests that detect markers that are commonly associated with IBD, along with a patient's history and physical exam, can all be useful in helping your doctor establish a diagnosis of IBD.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">What are the complications of IBD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease can lead to diarrhea, bleeding, anemia, weight loss, fevers, malnutrition and fistulae. IBD can also have extra-intestinal manifestations where areas other than your gastrointestinal system such as your skeletal system, your skin or your eyes may be involved.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">What medical treatments are available for IBD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Various formulations of 5-ASA, a drug which has been used to treat IBD for over 50 years, are available as oral preparations, suppositories and enemas. These are often one of the first drugs used to treat IBD.</p>
<p>Corticosteroid therapies, such as prednisone or hydrocortisone, are given when the 5-ASA products are insufficient to control inflammation. These drugs can be given orally, rectally as suppositories or enemas, or intravenously.<br>
Drugs which suppress the body's immune response in IBD (known as immunomodulators) are used. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are the two most commonly used immunomodulators for anti-immune therapy.</p>
Finally, a newer class of medications called "biologics" is used for patients with moderate to severe disease. Biologics include medications like infliximab (RemicadeÂ®), a medication given thru an IV infusion, and adalimumab (HumiraÂ®) and certolizumab pegol (CimziaÂ®), medications given via subcutaneous injection. </div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">Are there complications from the medical treatments?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Sulfasalazine, a 5-ASA product first used to treat IBD in the 1940s, may cause nausea, indigestion or headache in about 15 percent of patients and worsening diarrhea in about 4 percent of patients. The newer drugs have fewer side effects. Chronic corticosteroid therapy can lead to fluid retention and high blood pressure, some rounding of the face and softening of the bones similar to osteoporosis. These complications usually prompt attempts to discontinue corticosteroid treatment as soon as possible. The anti-immune drugs require periodic monitoring of the blood count since some patients will develop a low white blood cell count. These drugs, however, are usually well-tolerated in many patients. Biologics can alter a patient's ability to respond to any stressors to their immune system and in some patients may make it harder for their body to fight off infections.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">Is diet management important for patients with IBD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Physicians prefer to maintain good nutrition for those diagnosed with IBD. If you are responding well to medical management you can often eat a reasonably unrestricted diet. A low-roughage diet is often suggested for those prone to diarrhea after meals. If you appear to be milk sensitive (lactose intolerant), you are advised to either avoid milk products or use milk to which the enzyme lactase has been added.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">How successful is medical therapy?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>With early and proper treatment the majority of patients with IBD lead healthy and productive lives. Some patients may require surgery for treatment of complications of IBD such as an abscess, bowel obstruction or inadequate response to treatment.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease/" class="faqquestion">What are surgical options for IBD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Crohn's disease of the small or large intestine can be treated surgically for complications such as obstruction, abscess, fistula or failure to respond adequately to treatment. The disease may recur at some time after the operation.</p>
Ulcerative colitis is curable with removal of the entire colon. This may require creating an "ileostomy" (with attachment of the ileum to the external abdominal wall with an external application pouch) or may involve the direct attachment of the small intestine (ileum) to the anus. This type of surgery, known as "IPAA surgery," does not require an external application pouch </div>

        <a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/" class="faqquestion">What Is Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?</a>
        <div class="faqanswer">
            <p>
                IBS is a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, a condition in which symptoms are due to dysfunction of the gut, not a structural problem like cancer. Nevertheless it is a real and treatable medical condition.Â  IBS is a chronic disorder that is characterized by recurring (symptoms that come and go over time) abdominal discomfort or pain associated with an altered bowel habit, either constipation, diarrhea or both.Â  IBS is different from routine, occasional constipation or diarrhea.

                IBS is best defined by what it is NOT:
                <ul>
                    <li>an anatomical or structural problem</li>
                    <li>an identifiable physical or chemical disorder</li>
                    <li>a cancer and will not cause cancer</li>
                    <li>a precursor of other gastrointestinal diseases</li>
                    <li>something you have to 'just live with'</li>
                </ul>


                Contrary to popular belief, IBS is not a psychosomatic disorder. Stress and anxiety do not cause IBS. Instead, research suggests that IBS is dysfunction caused by changes in the nerves and muscles that control sensation and motility of the bowel.Â  IBS is 1.5â2 times more common in women than in men and is most commonly diagnosed in people under the age of 50.

                Remember, IBS is a real medical condition, but it is not life threatening, and will not lead to other serious diseases.Â  Your GI tract may work differently, moving more slowly (or more quickly) than the average.

            <p>IBS can have a substantial impact on patients' lives.Â  IBS symptoms can disrupt patients' daily lives causing them to miss school or work, reduce social activities and interactions, skip meals or make other changes to diet and nutrition.Â  Consumer surveys have established that IBS is a major reason for increased absences and reduced productivity. So, there are compelling reasons for employers to be interested in improving access to treatment for patients with IBS.Â  Overall, patients who have untreated IBS report significant reductions in their overall quality-of-life. According to studies, people with IBS make more visits to their physicians, undergo more diagnostic tests, are prescribed more medications, miss more workdays, have lower work productivity, are hospitalized more frequently, and account for greater overall direct healthcare costs than patients without IBS.Â  Research reveals that IBS can have such a severe impact on quality of life that it has been linked to an increase in suicidal behavior.</p>

        <a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/" class="faqquestion">Are There Different Types of IBS?</a>
        <div class="faqanswer">
            <p>Generally, doctors classify IBS based on the cluster of symptoms experienced by the patient including IBS with constipation (abdominal discomfort or pain, bloating and constipation), IBS with diarrhea (abdominal discomfort or pain, urgency and diarrhea) or IBS with mixed symptoms (constipation <span style="text-decoration: underline">and</span> diarrhea).Â  There are approximately an equal number of patients in each of these classifications.Â  By determining the type of IBS that you suffer from, doctors are able to determine the right treatment.Â  So it's important for you to describe all of your symptoms to your doctors including your bowel habit to your doctor.</p>

        <a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/" class="faqquestion">What Causes Bowel Symptoms in Irritable Bowel Syndrome?</a>
        <div class="faqanswer">
            <p>The exact cause of IBS is not clear.Â  However, recent medical research has shown that patients experiencing abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating and constipation or diarrhea may have a gastrointestinal (GI) tract that is more sensitive and works more slowly or quickly than it should.Â  Infrequent, occasional constipation or diarrhea is not abnormal.Â  Most people experience these symptoms from time to time. Diarrhea or constipation that is frequently accompanied by abdominal pain or bloating is a sign that you may have IBS and need to see the doctor.</p>

        <a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/" class="faqquestion">When Should You See the Doctor?</a>
        <div class="faqanswer">
            <p>If you experience recurring constipation or diarrhea that is associated with bothersome abdominal discomfort and/or bloating, you may have a real and treatable medical disorder called irritable bowel syndrome, and you should see your doctor or a gastrointestinal specialist to evaluate your symptoms.</p>

        <a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/" class="faqquestion">What is a Gastroenterologist?</a>
        <div class="faqanswer">
            <p>A gastroenterologist is a physician who specializes in disorders and conditions of the gastrointestinal tract.Â  Most gastroenterologists are board-certified in this subspecialty.Â  After completing the same training as all other physicians, they first complete at least another two years of additional training in order to attain board certification in internal medicine, then study for an additional 2-3 years to train specifically in conditions of the gastrointestinal tract.</p>

        <a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/" class="faqquestion">How is IBS Diagnosed?</a>
        <div class="faqanswer">
            <p>The doctor will start by asking you about your symptoms.Â  It's important for the doctor to understand the symptoms you are experiencing.Â  So, describe all of your symptoms to your doctor.Â  Tell your doctor about your abdominal discomfort, bloating and your bowel symptoms. Your doctor may ask if you strain or have difficulty having a bowel movement and ask you to describe the appearance of your bowel movement.Â  Your doctor will rule out other disorders.Â  You doctor will ask if you have experienced rectal bleeding, significant weight loss, recurring fever, anemia, and chronic severe diarrhea.Â  These symptoms may need additional evaluation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For most patients with IBS, a careful medical history, physical examination and a few blood tests are all that is necessary. Sometimes a colonoscopy (examination of the inside of the colon with a special tube with a TV camera on the end) is needed to exclude other conditions. Colonoscopic imaging should be performed in IBS patients with alarm features to rule out organic diseases and in those over the age of 50 years for the purpose of colorectal cancer screening.Â  The College recommends that African-Americans begin colorectal cancer screening at age 45.Â  When colonoscopy is performed in patients with IBS-D, obtaining random biopsies can be considered to rule out microscopic colitis</li>

        <a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/" class="faqquestion">New Recommendations on Diagnostic Testing in IBS</a>
        <div class="faqanswer">
            <p>Because of the low likelihood of uncovering organic diseases in patients with typical IBS symptoms, extensive diagnostic testing with thyroid function studies, stool for ova and parasites, and abdominal imaging should not be performed routinely in patients with typical IBS symptoms and no alarm features. Routine serologic screening for celiac sprue may be useful in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS or the mixed type of IBS.Â  Lactose breath testing can be considered when lactose maldigestion remains a concern despite dietary modification.</p>

        <a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/" class="faqquestion">Treatment by Adjusting Lifestyle, Diet &amp; Stress</a>
        <div class="faqanswer">
            <p>
                Traditionally much of the effort to treat IBS symptoms focused on lifestyle, diet and reduction of stress.Â There are some dietary changes that some patients have found helpful and can be tried by individuals with little risk:
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid or limit the amount of gas-producing foods, also known as high-FODMAP foods, such as fructose (fruit sugar), lactose (milk sugar), beans, onions, broccoli, or cabbage. Some people have trouble with gluten-containing foods (mainly wheat-containing products) and find that limiting gluten intake may be helpful. IBS patients also should avoid any other foods that you have found to aggravate your IBS symptoms. Diet modifications are most successful when they are supervised by a dietician.</li>
                    <li>Try to slow down how fast you eat and avoid overeating.</li>
                    <li>Extra water does not help. Drinking excessive water will not improve bowel habits or IBS symptoms.</li>
                    <li>Drinking carbonated drinks (colas, pop, soda) can introduce gas into the intestines and may cause abdominal pain. Chewing gum may lead to a significant amount of air being swallowed.</li>
                    <li>Avoid large quantities of the sugar substitutes sorbitol or mannitol, which can cause excess gas, bloating, cramping and diarrhea.</li>
                    <li>The addition of wheat bran or other dietary fiber may be suggested by your doctor in an attempt to decrease your symptoms, especially if you are constipated. Fiber may aggravate bloating, especially if the amount in the diet is increased rapidly, so it is important to start with a small amount and increase it slowly.</li>
                    <li>If you make any change to your diet, do it gradually to give your body time to adjust.</li>
                </ul>
                Psychological stress makes any condition harder to tolerate, and IBS and its symptoms are no exception.Â  Some patients have attained some relief through relaxation techniques and participation in regular exercise or a hobby.Â  IBS symptoms are not primarily manifestations of psychological disorders, butÂ behavioral therapies have been demonstrated to have positive impact on symptoms for some IBS patients.

        <a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/" class="faqquestion">What Other Treatments are Used for Symptoms of IBS?</a>
        <div class="faqanswer">
            <p>Since there is no cure for IBS at present, medical treatments for IBS are used to reduce the patient's predominant symptoms. There are a wide variety of available therapies, many of which improve patient well-being and individual IBS symptoms. Only a few therapies have been shown to be of benefit for all the symptoms of IBS. None of these treatments help every patient with IBS.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trials suggest that psyllium, fiber, certain antispasmodics, and peppermint oil are effective in IBS patients although the quality of the evidence is poor.</li>
                <li>Anti-diarrheal drugs, such as loperamide, reduce the frequency of bowel movements in patients with IBS with diarrhea, and laxatives, , such as milk of magnesia or polyethylene glycol, increase stool frequency in IBS with constipation, but neither treatment affects pain.</li>
                <li>Evidence suggests that specific probiotics ("good bacteria") may be effective in reducing overall IBS symptoms but more data are needed.</li>
                <li>Some people with IBS are thought to have too many germs in the small intestine. A 14-day course of the non-absorbable antibiotic, rifaximin, reduces symptoms in some IBS with diarrhea patients, sometimes for months after being given, and has been approved for use by the FDA. If symptoms improve, repeated short courses are allowed. If it doesnât work, other drugs should be tried.</li>
                <li>Another drug approved for use in patients with IBS with diarrhea is the opioid-receptor ligand, eluxadoline. This drug is an agonist at mu- and kappa-opioid receptors and an antagonist at delta-opioid receptors in the gut nerves. By slowing peristalsis and reducing pain, it helps the major symptoms of IBS with diarrhea. When used in recommended doses, it is unlikely to affect brain function. It cannot be used in patients who are alcoholics or who have had their gallbladders removed because of concern about pancreatitis or sphincter of Oddi spasm.</li>
                <li>Agents that work on the serotonin receptors in the nerves in the gut or spinal cord have been tried to treat IBS. These medicines have proven value in some patients:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The 5HT 3 antagonist, alosetron, slows peristalsis and reduces pain from the gut; it is efficacious in women with IBS with diarrhea.Â  Patients need to be carefully selected, however, because potentially serious side effects include severe constipation and reduced blood flow to the colon.Â  Current use of alosetron is regulated by a prescribing program set forth by the FDA. It can only be used in women with severe IBS with diarrhea who have failed other treatments.</li>
                    <li>The 5HT4 agonist, prucalopride, speeds peristalsis and reduces pain from the gut; it helps patients who have IBS with constipation and has been approved for use in Canada and Europe. It is not yet approved by the FDA.</li>
                    <li>Tricyclic anti-depressants and more modern antidepressants (selective serotonin and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) reduce pain and seem to be effective for pain relief in IBS patients of all subtypes.Â  These drugs are used in low doses to reduce pain in IBS, and not specifically to treat depression.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Another group of drugs used in patients with IBS are those that modulate chloride and fluid secretion in the gut by opening pores ("channels") that let ions in and out of the lining cells of the gut. The selective C-2 chloride channel activator, lubiprostone, allows more chloride and water to enter the intestine and is efficacious in chronic constipation and IBS with constipation. Linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase C agonist, opens a different set of channels and also may inhibit pain-sensing nerves; it is approved for chronic constipation and IBS with constipation. Plecanatide is another guanylate cyclase C agonist that currently is approved for chronic constipation and is being evaluated for IBS with constipation.</li>
                <li>Psychological therapies, such as psychotherapy and hypnotism, also may provide benefit to IBS patients although the quality of evidence is limited.</li>
                <li>Alternative therapies, such as unique Chinese herbal mixtures or acupuncture, may have a benefit in some patients with IBS, but more standardization and studies are needed before any recommendations about the use of these treatments can be made.</li>
           </ul>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/" class="faqquestion">What is Irritable Bowel Syndrome?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of bowelÂ <em>function</em>Â (as opposed to being due to an anatomic abnormality). Patients who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome have changes in bowel habits such as constipation or diarrhea, and abdominal pain along with other symptoms including abdominal bloating, and rectal urgency with diarrhea. In addition, irritable bowel syndrome may be associated with a number of non-intestinal ("extraintestinal symptoms"), such as difficulty with sexual function (pain on intercourse or lack of libido), muscle aches and pains, fatigue, fibromyalgia syndrome, headaches, back pain, and sometimes urinary symptoms including urinary urgency, urinary hesitation or a feeling of spasm in the bladder.</p>
<p>IBS is an extremely common disorder. Studies have estimated the prevalence in the United States is somewhere between 10% and 15% of the entire population. IBS is seen in similar frequencies in other countries around the world. Most studies suggest that irritable bowel syndrome is more common in women with almost twice as many women having the disorder compared to men. The reason why women are more commonly affected by irritable bowel syndrome is not completely understood. It does not seem to be merely due to hormonal differences between men and women. Rather it seems to be due to differences in how women and men process sensations from the intestines, both in the intestinal nervous system ( "enteric nervous sytem") as well as the brain and spinal cord ("central nervous system"). The frequency of IBS seems to be the same across racial, ethnic and national boundaries.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that irritable bowel syndrome is so common, most people with IBS do not see a doctor for their symptoms. It is estimated that only 1 in 4 people with IBS see a doctor (and thus become a patient with IBS). Reasons why some people chose to see a doctor and others do not are not completely understood. Interestingly the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms from IBS alone does not seem to be the major driving factor. Rather the impact of IBS on the patient's ability to function on a day-to-day basis while having IBS symptoms, the stress from having IBS, and concerns about other diseases that they might have are some of the more frequent reasons patients see their doctor for IBS like symptoms.</p>
<p>Irritable bowel syndrome is not associated with serious medical consequences. People with IBS tend to live long, and in some studies, somewhat longer than individuals who do not have IBS. IBS is not a risk factor for other serious GI diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) or colon cancer. The presence of IBS does not put extra stress on the other organs in the body such as the heart, liver or kidneys. Overall the prognosis for irritable bowel syndrome is excellent. Patients suffering from IBS should not be worried about it leading to other serious diseases. The major problem with IBS is not that it causes death, but because it changes the quality of life for people who suffer from it. In the last 20 years, we have come to understand how important quality of life is for patients suffering from health problems (called 'health related quality of life', HRQOL for short). We now understand that the severity of all diseases, not just IBS, cannot be measured only with tests or how severe symptoms are. Rather we have begun to understand that the true measure of the impact of any disorder is the negative impact on a patient's HRQOL. In IBS, health related quality of life is usually not as good compared to people who do not have IBS. This makes IBS a particularly troublesome disorder.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that that when compared to patients with diabetes, gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD), as well as individuals who have no gastro intestinal disorders, patients with IBS had significantly higher degrees of impairment in their quality of life. By this is meant their physical functioning, their ability to participate in the activities of daily living, their level of emotional distress, as well as their sexual functioning and all the other components that go into a happy and healthy normal life without disease. This is the true impact of IBS and is an important reason that it deserves serious attention from the medical community. IBS is also a costly disease, not only in terms of money spent for health care but also money lost because of a patient's inability to work while they have symptoms. It is estimated that IBS causes a loss of $30 to $90 billion per year in productivity. After the common cold, IBS is the second most frequent reason people take days off from work in the United States. This makes IBS a very important issue for the society in general, which clearly needs to be addressed by the medical community.</p>
<p>Irritable bowel syndrome is not a trivial illness. It deeply affects the quality of life of the patient and their ability to function effectively in society. The economic cost of irritable bowel syndrome has been estimated to be over $80 billion a year to the American economy. However, above and beyond this is the large number of people in our society who experience IBS symptoms daily who in the past have suffered in silence because there were no effective treatments available. Patients with IBS should see their physician and get recommendations on the latest treatments available. However, it is also important that the patient with IBS understand that although this is a chronic illness, symptoms can be controlled, and the overall prognosis is actually quite good.</p>

<p>If you have some or all of these symptoms, you may suffer from a treatable medical condition called irritable bowel syndrome or IBS.Â  While not life threatening, this disorder can have significant impact on your life.</p>
<p>If you suffer from these symptoms, see your doctor, talk about your symptoms and ask about treatment that may be right for you.Â  For many sufferers, the abdominal discomfort, bloating and constipation of IBS can be managed effectively.Â  For those patients who seek care, physicians have treatment options that can relieve the abdominal pain, bloating and constipation of IBS and improve your quality of life, giving you the relief you deserve.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/" class="faqquestion">What Is Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>IBS is a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, a condition in which symptoms are due to dysfunction of the gut, not a structural problem like cancer. Nevertheless it is a real and treatable medical condition.Â  IBS is a chronic disorder that is characterized by recurring (symptoms that come and go over time) abdominal discomfort or pain associated with an altered bowel habit, either constipation, diarrhea or both.Â  IBS is different from routine, occasional constipation or diarrhea.</p>
<p>IBS is best defined by what it is NOT:</p>
<ul>
  <li>an anatomical or structural problem</li>
  <li>an identifiable physical or chemical disorder</li>
  <li>a cancer and will not cause cancer</li>
  <li>a precursor of other gastrointestinal diseases</li>
  <li>something you have to âjust live withâ</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, IBS is not a psychosomatic disorder. Stress and anxiety do not cause IBS. Instead, research suggests that IBS is dysfunction caused by changes in the nerves and muscles that control sensation and motility of the bowel.Â  IBS is 1.5â2 times more common in women than in men and is most commonly diagnosed in people under the age of 50.</p>
<p>Remember, IBS is a real medical condition, but it is not life threatening, and will not lead to other serious diseases.Â  Your GI tract may work differently, moving more slowly (or more quickly) than the average.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The exact cause of irritable bowel syndrome is not known. However, tremendous advances in our understanding of this common and disabling disorder have been made in the last 10 years. Abnormal motility in terms of the bowel moving too fast (which causes diarrhea) or too slow (which causes constipation) is certainly part of this syndrome. However, this represents only one part of a complicated disorder. The symptoms of pain, incomplete emptying of the bowels, and bloating cannot be explained only by abnormal gut GI motility. Over the last 20 years a number of very well done scientific studies have demonstrated that individuals with IBS tend to have higher levels of sensitivity in the intestines compared to individuals who do not have IBS.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, we have identified certain chemicals present in the gut, which send signals from nerve endings from the intestines to the brain, and also from the brain to the intestines. These chemicals are called "neuro transmitters" and work as messengers between nerve endings to carry signals including painful sensations in both directions. This is very important because this has led to the development of new drugs to treat IBS. Some of these drugs are currently available. Others are in development. As we identify more and more of these substances and better understand their actions, we may be able to further supplement the arsenal of medications that will influence these neuro transmitters and thus help relieve the symptoms of IBS. A number of other interesting theories have been put forward in the last few years. One is the concept that IBS may be triggered by an intestinal infection. A small but significant number of people contract IBS-like symptoms which persist after suffering from an acute self limited (and ultimately resolved) gastrointestinal infection. This suggests a possible role for either the activation of inflammatory transmitters or possibly an immune reaction to the original infectious agent (the germ or virus). Again, the exact mechanism why this occurs is not clear and is under intense investigation.</p>
<p>Another interesting theory which has been put forward is the possibility is that IBS may result from overgrowth of normal bacteria in the gut. This "bacterial overgrowth" is an intriguing theory. However there have been a number of conflicting studies to support/not support this theory. What is interesting is that there are IBS patients that do indeed seem to respond to treatment with antibiotics. Again, the exact reason why bacterial overgrowth would exist in patients with IBS and/or cause IBS to occur has not been completely explained. It represents another provocative perspective on the role of gut flora in the generation of bowel disorders.</p>
<p>Although it is proposed in some quarters there is little evidence to support that IBS results from "food intolerance". This is to be differentiated however with the fact that celiac disease, an autoimmune disease that cause a violent inflammatory reaction in the intestine to the protein gluten can mimic the symptoms of IBS. Recent evidence shows that in patients with IBS-like symptoms testing for celiac disease, which can be accomplished with a simple blood test, should be considered, particularly if IBS like symptoms do not respond to reasonable treatment.</p>
<p>Clearly the future is quite bright both for better understanding this perplexing and disabling disorder as well as using this knowledge to make newer and better treatments for IBS available.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/" class="faqquestion">How is Irritable Bowel Syndrome Diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Irritable bowel syndrome has several symptoms. A number of IBS experts have met over the last 15 years in Rome, Italy to decide which symptoms would help doctors to make the diagnosis of IBS and other similar diseases as well as to discuss the best methods to diagnose and treat these diseases. The "Rome Diagnostic Criteria" that these experts proposed say that a patient must have symptoms consistent with IBS for at least 3 months over the previous year before this diagnosis can be considered. Altered bowel habits and the presence of lower abdominal pain is key to making a diagnosis of IBS. There are other parts to the Rome Criteria and these can be obtained from your physician. Your doctor can use the Rome Criteria to make a diagnosis of IBS.</p>
<p>However, taking a careful medical history is essential to identifying IBS, and identifying and addressing through treatment the specific symptom complaints of the patient is a key component. Should your doctor in the course of his/ her history taking, physical examination discover findings which are of concern he or she will order additional tests to make sure you do not have other gastro intestinal disorders. Should nothing emerge during your doctor visit from the history, physical examination and from routine blood studies that are commonly performed during an office visit for IBS-like symptoms your doctor will most likely make an IBS diagnosis.</p>
<p>The safety and accuracy of making an IBS diagnosis based on the Rome III criteria has been the subject of a number of studies which have confirmed these criteria as accurate and correct in making a diagnosis of IBS anywhere from 65% to 100% of the time, again with strong reliance on the patient's symptoms. In most cases endoscopy (looking at the lining of the stomach and upper intestines and/or colon by the use of an endoscope, a long tube with a video camera at the tip) is not necessary for the diagnosis of IBS. There are a number of situations where endoscopy may be performed. The first is that everyone should be screened for colon cancer according to standard guidelines.</p>
<p>Anyone age 50 or older who has IBS-like symptoms should have a colonoscopy as part of a routine screening examination to rule out colon cancer. For people who have a family history of colon cancer in a parent, brother or sister the recommended age for screening colonoscopy is 40 years old. African Americans are more likely to develop colon cancer at an earlier age and should also consider colonoscopy screening at age 40. Likewise, your doctor may perform upper endoscopy if you have certain symptoms like persistent diarrhea that does not sound like IBS. Your doctor may also order other tests like a CT scan of the abdomen (a special x-ray of the abdomen which shows the organs in the abdomen particularly the pancreas, gall bladder and liver as well as the intestines) or certain blood tests. Surgery is rarely required for the diagnosis of IBS and should be avoided. Sometimes patients are willing to undergo surgery because their pain is so severe. Studies have shown that surgery done only for an indication of IBS-like pain is usually not helpful in finding the cause of the patient's pain and rarely leads to improvement in a patient's pain symptoms.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/" class="faqquestion">New Recommendations on Diagnostic Testing in IBS</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Because of the low likelihood of uncovering organic diseases in patients with typical IBS symptoms, extensive diagnostic testing with thyroid function studies, stool for ova and parasites, and abdominal imaging should not be performed routinely in patients with typical IBS symptoms and no alarm features. Routine serologic screening for celiac sprue may be useful in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS or the mixed type of IBS.Â  Lactose breath testing can be considered when lactose maldigestion remains a concern despite dietary modification.</p>

        <a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/" class="faqquestion">How is IBS Treated?</a>
        <div class="faqanswer">
            <p>
                Traditionally much of the effort to treat IBS symptoms focused on lifestyle, diet and reduction of stress. There are some dietary changes that some patients have found helpful and can be tried by individuals with little risk:
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid or limit the amount of gas-producing foods, also known as high-FODMAP foods, such as fructose (fruit sugar), lactose (milk sugar), beans, onions, broccoli, or cabbage. Some people have trouble with gluten-containing foods (mainly wheat-containing products) and find that limiting gluten intake may be helpful. IBS patients also should avoid any other foods that you have found to aggravate your IBS symptoms. Diet modifications are most successful when they are supervised by a dietician.</li>
                    <li>Try to slow down how fast you eat and avoid overeating.</li>
                    <li>Extra water does not help. Drinking excessive water will not improve bowel habits or IBS symptoms.</li>
                    <li>Drinking carbonated drinks (colas, pop, soda) can introduce gas into the intestines and may cause abdominal pain. Chewing gum may lead to a significant amount of air being swallowed.</li>
                    <li>Avoid large quantities of the sugar substitutes sorbitol or mannitol, which can cause excess gas, bloating, cramping and diarrhea.</li>
                    <li>The addition of wheat bran or other dietary fiber may be suggested by your doctor in an attempt to decrease your symptoms, especially if you are constipated. Fiber may aggravate bloating, especially if the amount in the diet is increased rapidly, so it is important to start with a small amount and increase it slowly.</li>
                    <li>If you make any change to your diet, do it gradually to give your body time to adjust.</li>
                </ul>
                Psychological stress makes any condition harder to tolerate, and IBS and its symptoms are no exception.  Some patients have attained some relief through relaxation techniques and participation in regular exercise or a hobby.  IBS symptoms are not primarily manifestations of psychological disorders, but behavioral therapies have been demonstrated to have positive impact on symptoms for some IBS patients.
            </p>

 <li>
        <a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/" class="faqquestion">What Other Treatments are Used for Symptoms of IBS?</a>
        <div class="faqanswer">
            <p>Since there is no cure for IBS at present, medical treatments for IBS are used to reduce the patient's predominant symptoms. There are a wide variety of available therapies, many of which improve patient well-being and individual IBS symptoms. Only a few therapies have been shown to be of benefit for all the symptoms of IBS. None of these treatments help every patient with IBS.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trials suggest that psyllium, fiber, certain antispasmodics, and peppermint oil are effective in IBS patients although the quality of the evidence is poor.</li>
                <li>Anti-diarrheal drugs, such as loperamide, reduce the frequency of bowel movements in patients with IBS with diarrhea, and laxatives, , such as milk of magnesia or polyethylene glycol, increase stool frequency in IBS with constipation, but neither treatment affects pain.</li>
                <li>Evidence suggests that specific probiotics ("good bacteria") may be effective in reducing overall IBS symptoms but more data are needed.</li>
                <li>Some people with IBS are thought to have too many germs in the small intestine. A 14-day course of the non-absorbable antibiotic, rifaximin, reduces symptoms in some IBS with diarrhea patients, sometimes for months after being given, and has been approved for use by the FDA. If symptoms improve, repeated short courses are allowed. If it doesnât work, other drugs should be tried.</li>
                <li>Another drug approved for use in patients with IBS with diarrhea is the opioid-receptor ligand, eluxadoline. This drug is an agonist at mu- and kappa-opioid receptors and an antagonist at delta-opioid receptors in the gut nerves. By slowing peristalsis and reducing pain, it helps the major symptoms of IBS with diarrhea. When used in recommended doses, it is unlikely to affect brain function. It cannot be used in patients who are alcoholics or who have had their gallbladders removed because of concern about pancreatitis or sphincter of Oddi spasm.</li>
                <li>Agents that work on the serotonin receptors in the nerves in the gut or spinal cord have been tried to treat IBS. These medicines have proven value in some patients:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The 5HT 3 antagonist, alosetron, slows peristalsis and reduces pain from the gut; it is efficacious in women with IBS with diarrhea.  Patients need to be carefully selected, however, because potentially serious side effects include severe constipation and reduced blood flow to the colon.  Current use of alosetron is regulated by a prescribing program set forth by the FDA. It can only be used in women with severe IBS with diarrhea who have failed other treatments.</li>
                    <li>The 5HT4 agonist, prucalopride, speeds peristalsis and reduces pain from the gut; it helps patients who have IBS with constipation and has been approved for use in Canada and Europe. It is not yet approved by the FDA.</li>
                    <li>Tricyclic anti-depressants and more modern antidepressants (selective serotonin and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) reduce pain and seem to be effective for pain relief in IBS patients of all subtypes.  These drugs are used in low doses to reduce pain in IBS, and not specifically to treat depression.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Another group of drugs used in patients with IBS are those that modulate chloride and fluid secretion in the gut by opening pores ("channels") that let ions in and out of the lining cells of the gut. The selective C-2 chloride channel activator, lubiprostone, allows more chloride and water to enter the intestine and is efficacious in chronic constipation and IBS with constipation. Linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase C agonist, opens a different set of channels and also may inhibit pain-sensing nerves; it is approved for chronic constipation and IBS with constipation. Plecanatide is another guanylate cyclase C agonist that currently is approved for chronic constipation and is being evaluated for IBS with constipation.</li>
                <li>Psychological therapies, such as psychotherapy and hypnotism, also may provide benefit to IBS patients although the quality of evidence is limited.</li>
                <li>Alternative therapies, such as unique Chinese herbal mixtures or acupuncture, may have a benefit in some patients with IBS, but more standardization and studies are needed before any recommendations about the use of these treatments can be made.</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/obesity/" class="faqquestion">What is obesity and how is it measured?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Obesity is a term used to describe body weight that is significantly greater than what is considered healthy. If you are obese, you have a higher amount of body fat compared to lean muscle mass. Importantly, obesity is a diagnosis, not a judgment of character.</p>

<p>One of the simplest and most accepted ways to measure obesity involves calculation of the body mass index (BMI). BMI is a determination of body fat based on height and weight. Adults with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 are considered overweight while those with a BMI of 30 or more are considered obese. Obesity can be further classified as Class I, II or III depending upon the degree of increase in BMI over 30. Class III obesity is sometimes referred to as extreme obesity. Morbid obesity is when an obesity-associated complication (see below) exists in an individual with any class of obesity. BMI does have some limitations - it may overestimate body fat in those with a muscular build and it may underestimate body fat in those who have lost muscle mass.</p>

<p>You can calculate your own BMI from your height and weight using the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) calculator at <a href="http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/bmicalc.htm" target="_blank">www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/bmicalc.htm</a> or you can look it up on the NHLBI BMI table at <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/bmi_tbl.htm" target="_blank">www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/bmi_tbl.htm</a>.</p>

<p>The places where you store your body fat may affect your health. Some people store fat primarily in their hips and buttocks while others store fat primarily in their abdomen. If most of your fat is in your abdomen rather than in your hips, you're at higher risk for heart disease, cancer and diabetes. <strong>Waist circumference</strong> can be used as a measure of abdominal fat. A waist circumference of more than 35 inches around in women or more than 40 inches around in men puts them at higher risk of weight-related health problems.</p>

<p><em>To measure your waist circumference</em>, stand straight, loop a tape measure around your bare abdomen just above your hip bones, bringing the tape measure together at the belly button. Take the measurement when the tape is snug but not pinching and just after you breathe out.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/obesity/" class="faqquestion">Why should I care about obesity?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Obesity is a problem of epidemic proportions in the United States and worldwide. Recent nationwide surveys have shown that about two-thirds of adults in the United States are overweight or obese while over one-third are obese. This amounts to millions of people in the United States alone. Being obese affects more than just appearance as it puts you at risk for many conditions including high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, sleep apnea and certain cancers. Being obese also puts you at risk of premature death. Certainly, the emotional (psychological and social) effects of obesity can be significant as well. The diseases associated with obesity are responsible for a substantial amount of health care costs related to doctor visits, testing, treatments and hospitalizations in the United States. The table, <strong>Risks of Obesity-Associated Diseases by BMI and Waist Circumference</strong> <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/obesity/lose_wt/risk.htm" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline">(www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/obesity/lose_wt/bmi_dis.htm)</span></a>, provides you with an idea of whether your BMI combined with your waist circumference increases your risk for developing obesity-associated conditions.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/obesity/" class="faqquestion">Is obesity a problem in children?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Obesity is being seen more and more often in children. This is of major concern because children who are overweight have a greater chance of becoming obese adults. Like adults, overweight children may develop associated health problems. Overweight is defined differently for children than it is for adults because children are still growing and boys and girls mature at different rates. <strong>BMI-for-age percentile</strong> is used for children to compare their heights and weights against growth charts that take age and sex into account. You can find out your child's BMI-for-age and growth charts for children using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's <strong><a href="http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/Calculator.aspx" target="_blank">BMI-for-age calculator</a></strong>.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/obesity/" class="faqquestion">What causes obesity?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Obesity occurs when you eat more calories than you use doing activities - your body stores the difference. A calorie is a unit of energy in food and drink. Your body needs energy to be healthy and active but if you take in more energy than your body uses, over time you will gain weight. Be aware that eating a diet consisting of low-fat or low-carbohydrate/sugar foods without accounting for the total number of calories consumed can result in weight gain! In addition to eating, activity level and exercise habits, a person's weight is a result of many factors including the environment and culture in which they live, their family history and genetics, and how their body uses the energy consumed ('metabolism').</p>

<p>Other factors such as certain medical conditions, pregnancy, emotional factors, smoking cessation, aging and lack of sleep may also contribute. Importantly, while hypothyroidism (low thyroid function) is often blamed as a cause of obesity, its role has largely been exaggerated. Certainly, obesity should not be attributed to thyroid disease if adequate thyroid replacement treatment is in place. Finally, some medications may also cause weight gain and increase body fat, although the propensity of these medications to increase body weight differs considerably. Examples of some medications that may cause weight gain are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Psychotropic medications</li>
  <ul>
	<li>Tricyclic antidepressants</li>
	<li>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors</li>
	<li>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</li>
	<li>Lithium</li>
	<li>Specific anticonvulsants</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Valproic acid</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
	<li>Î²-adrenergic receptor blockers</li>
	<li>Diabetes medications</li>
    <ul>
	<li>Insulin</li>
	<li>Sulfonylurea's</li>
	<li>Thiazolidinediones</li>
    </ul>
	<li>Highly active antiretroviral therapy</li>
	<li>Tamoxifen</li>
	<li>Steroid hormones</li>
    <ul>
	<li>Corticosteroids (for example, prednisone)</li>
	<li>Progestational steroids</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>Valproic acid may cause considerable weight gain of 15-20 kg, whereas the Î²-adrenergic receptor blocker, propranolol, is associated with much smaller weight gain. The mechanism responsible for medication-induced weight gain may be related to an increase in energy intake (e.g. antipsychotics and steroid hormones), a decrease in energy expenditure (e.g. Î²-adrenergic receptor blockers), a decrease in energy loss (e.g. decreased glucosuria from diabetes therapy), or a combination of these factors. Decreasing the dose if possible or substituting for another drug with less weight gain potential may facilitate weight loss.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/obesity/" class="faqquestion">Who is most at risk of becoming obese?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Virtually anyone can become obese but certain people seem to be at higher risk because of their race, ethnicity and income. Overweight and obesity are highest for non-Hispanic Black women and Mexican-American women compared to non-Hispanic White women. In men, Mexican-Americans are at highest risk. Persons from low-income families are at a higher risk, possibly because they may buy more high-calorie, high-fat foods which tend to cost less than more healthy foods.</p>

<p>In addition to the risks of obesity to your general health like heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes, obesity is also associated with a number of conditions that affect your digestive system, pancreas and liver. Many of the gastrointestinal diseases that are commonly seen in normal weight individuals are seen up to 2 to 3 times more commonly in those who are obese.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/obesity/" class="faqquestion">How is obesity treated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>A person's motivation, commitment, and compliance are critical for long-term weight loss success - certainly, knowing that weight loss can reduce blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar levels, and many other obesity-associated health risks can be very motivating! The goals of treatment are first to prevent further weight gain, and then to reduce body weight and maintain the lower body weight over the long-term. A number of factors play a role in deciding about the most appropriate treatment of obesity including a person's BMI, waist circumference, associated health conditions, and their motivation to lose weight.</p>
<p>Important facts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Body weight  alone can be used to follow weight loss, and to determine the  effectiveness of a weight loss treatment.</li>
  <li>The initial  goal of weight loss therapy should be to reduce body weight by about 10  percent from baseline over 6 to 12 months.</li>
  <li>To lose  weight, you must use more energy than you take in.</li>
  <li>To improve  long-term success, lose weight gradually (1-2 pounds/week).</li>
  <li>Long-term  behavior modification therapy is necessary for long-term weight loss.</li>
  <li>If unable to  lose weight, prevent further weight gain by exploring your barriers to  weight reduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment generally begins with lower calorie and lower fat meals, increasing physical activity, and incorporating behavioral modification techniques like engaging social support, using stimulus control, and stress management. Medications or surgical management require physician supervision. Before beginning a weight loss program, you should consult with your health care provider to know which of these treatments is right for you. Do make sure your provider is aware if you suffer from chest pains, dizziness or fainting, or if you plan a vigorous program and are over age 40 (men) or 50 (women).</p>
<p><strong><em>Reduced Calorie Diet and Exercise</em></strong></p>
<p>Treatment starts with a combination of a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. Cutting back intake by 500-1000 kcal daily can lead to a 26 to 55 pound weight loss in 6 months, with an average loss of around 26-35 pounds. A difference of one 12-oz. soda (150 calories) or 30 minutes of brisk walking most days can add or subtract approximately 10 pounds to your weight each year. Reducing your calorie intake by 150 calories a day, along with participating in moderate activity, could double your weight loss and is equivalent to approximately 20 pounds in 1 year. Fad diets and very-low calorie diets can result in substantial weight loss rapidly; however, the sustainability of these diets and their long-term benefits and health consequences are not well documented. Consult with your physician for the diet that's right for you.</p>

</table>
<p><strong><em>Behavior Therapy</em></strong><br>
  The importance of behavior modification cannot be stressed enough. <strong>Unless you change the way you think about food and exercise habits, weight loss is unlikely to be maintained over the long-term.</strong> Behavioral strategies to reinforce changes in diet and physical activity can produce a weight loss in the range of 10 percent of baseline weight over 4-12 months. Behavioral strategies include stress management, social support, recording food and calorie intake, and modifying environmental cues that are associated with overeating and inactivity. Commercial weight loss programs that promote these behavioral changes may be useful.</p>
<p><strong><em>Medications</em></strong><br>
When a reduced calorie diet, increased physical activity, and behavior modification are unsuccessful in creating significant sustained weight loss, medications may be helpful in selected patients. Medications may be considered in patients with a BMI of â¥ 30 or in those with a BMI of â¥ 27.5 with concomitant risk factors (e.g., smoking) or obesity-related illnesses (e.g. diabetes, heart disease). At present, two medications are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for long-term use as weight loss aids: Sibutramine and Orlistat. A lower dose form of orlistat is available over-the-counter (Alli). Both orlistat and sibutramine are most effective when taken in conjunction with a low fat/low calorie diet, regular exercise and behavior therapy. There is no convincing evidence to support the use of the so-called "fat burners" that are commonly advertised.</p>
<p><strong><em>Surgery</em></strong><br>
Weight loss surgery is currently the most effective treatment for morbid obesity and the only effective approach for the extremely obese. Weight loss surgery may be an option in carefully selected patients with a BMI of â¥ 40 without obesity-associated health problems and â¥ 35 in those with obesity-associated health problems. Weight loss surgery should be reserved for patients in whom medical efforts have failed and who are suffering the complications of extreme obesity. Currently, the most common surgeries performed are gastric banding and the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) restricts the entrance of food into the lower part of the stomach by placing a tight, adjustable prosthetic band around the entrance to the stomach. The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) both restricts the amount of food comfortably ingested by dividing the stomach and creating a small gastric pouch, and reconfigures the anatomy of the upper small intestine, thereby creating some degree of malabsorption. The RYGB is a much more technically complex operation but can also be performed laparoscopically.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://patients.gi.org/files/2011/08/heart1.png" alt="" width="227" height="235" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154" /><img src="http://patients.gi.org/files/2011/08/heart2.png" alt="" width="200" height="235" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-155" /></p>
<p>These procedures normally result in sustained weight loss between 15% and 40% of total body weight, with a maximum weight loss about 12 months after the operation. The RYGB is more effective than the LAGB at causing sustained weight loss. Importantly, some individuals gain back weight in the long-term, emphasizing the point that the results from these surgical procedures are most effective when combined with a low fat/low calorie diet, regular exercise and behavior modification. An experienced surgeon and participation in an after-care program are recommended to optimize the chance for optimal results. It is also important to recognize that complications and mortality following surgical treatment of severe obesity do occur and vary based upon the procedure performed.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/obesity/" class="faqquestion">Can obesity be prevented?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Maintaining a healthy weight requires a balance of the calories consumed from foods and beverages with the calories expended through physical activity and normal metabolism. Healthy foods can provide adequate nutrition and an appropriate number of calories and developing healthy eating habits can lead to healthier favorite dishes and reduced calorie-rich temptations.<br>
To promote healthy eating habits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole-grain products.</li>
  <li>Include low-fat or non-fat milk or dairy products.</li>
  <li>Choose lean meats, poultry, fish, lentils, and beans for protein.</li>
  <li>Serve reasonably-sized portions.</li>
  <li>Drink lots of water.</li>
  <li>Limit fruit juice and sodas</li>
  <li>Limit consumption of sugar and saturated fat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that small changes every day can lead to significant benefit over time. In addition to healthy eating, an active lifestyle will help maintain your weight. Choosing to add more physical activity to your day will increase the amount of calories your body burns. This makes it more likely that you'll maintain your weight.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Obesity is a term used to describe body weight that is significantly greater than what is considered healthy. If you are obese, you have a higher amount of body fat compared to lean muscle mass. Importantly, obesity is a diagnosis, not a judgment of character.</p>

<p>One of the simplest and most accepted ways to measure obesity involves calculation of the body mass index (BMI). BMI is a determination of body fat based on height and weight. Adults with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 are considered overweight while those with a BMI of 30 or more are considered obese. Obesity can be further classified as Class I, II or III depending upon the degree of increase in BMI over 30. Class III obesity is sometimes referred to as extreme obesity. Morbid obesity is when an obesity-associated complication (see below) exists in an individual with any class of obesity. BMI does have some limitations - it may overestimate body fat in those with a muscular build and it may underestimate body fat in those who have lost muscle mass.</p>

<p>You can calculate your own BMI from your height and weight using the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) calculator at <a href="http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/bmicalc.htm" target="_blank">www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/bmicalc.htm</a> or you can look it up on the NHLBI BMI table at <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/bmi_tbl.htm" target="_blank">www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/bmi_tbl.htm</a>.</p>

<p>The places where you store your body fat may affect your health. Some people store fat primarily in their hips and buttocks while others store fat primarily in their abdomen. If most of your fat is in your abdomen rather than in your hips, you're at higher risk for heart disease, cancer and diabetes. <strong>Waist circumference</strong> can be used as a measure of abdominal fat. A waist circumference of more than 35 inches around in women or more than 40 inches around in men puts them at higher risk of weight-related health problems.</p>

<p><em>To measure your waist circumference</em>, stand straight, loop a tape measure around your bare abdomen just above your hip bones, bringing the tape measure together at the belly button. Take the measurement when the tape is snug but not pinching and just after you breathe out.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Obesity occurs when you eat more calories than you use doing activities - your body stores the difference. A calorie is a unit of energy in food and drink. Your body needs energy to be healthy and active but if you take in more energy than your body uses, over time you will gain weight. Be aware that eating a diet consisting of low-fat or low-carbohydrate/sugar foods without accounting for the total number of calories consumed can result in weight gain! In addition to eating, activity level and exercise habits, a person's weight is a result of many factors including the environment and culture in which they live, their family history and genetics, and how their body uses the energy consumed ('metabolism').</p>

<p>Other factors such as certain medical conditions, pregnancy, emotional factors, smoking cessation, aging and lack of sleep may also contribute. Importantly, while hypothyroidism (low thyroid function) is often blamed as a cause of obesity, its role has largely been exaggerated. Certainly, obesity should not be attributed to thyroid disease if adequate thyroid replacement treatment is in place. Finally, some medications may also cause weight gain and increase body fat, although the propensity of these medications to increase body weight differs considerably. Examples of some medications that may cause weight gain are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Psychotropic medications</li>
  <ul>
	<li>Tricyclic antidepressants</li>
	<li>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors</li>
	<li>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</li>
	<li>Lithium</li>
	<li>Specific anticonvulsants</li>
    <ul>
	<li>Valproic acid</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
	<li>Î²-adrenergic receptor blockers</li>
	<li>Diabetes medications</li>
  <ul>
	<li>Insulin</li>
	<li>Sulfonylurea's</li>
	<li>Thiazolidinediones</li>
  </ul>
	<li>Highly active antiretroviral therapy</li>
	<li>Tamoxifen</li>
	<li>Steroid hormones</li>
  <ul>
	<li>Corticosteroids (for example, prednisone)</li>
	<li>Progestational steroids</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>Valproic acid may cause considerable weight gain of 15-20 kg, whereas the Î²-adrenergic receptor blocker, propranolol, is associated with much smaller weight gain. The mechanism responsible for medication-induced weight gain may be related to an increase in energy intake (e.g. antipsychotics and steroid hormones), a decrease in energy expenditure (e.g. Î²-adrenergic receptor blockers), a decrease in energy loss (e.g. decreased glucosuria from diabetes therapy), or a combination of these factors. Decreasing the dose if possible or substituting for another drug with less weight gain potential may facilitate weight loss.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Virtually anyone can become obese but certain people seem to be at higher risk because of their race, ethnicity and income. Overweight and obesity are highest for non-Hispanic Black women and Mexican-American women compared to non-Hispanic White women. In men, Mexican-Americans are at highest risk. Persons from low-income families are at a higher risk, possibly because they may buy more high-calorie, high-fat foods which tend to cost less than more healthy foods.</p>

<p><strong>What gastrointestinal diseases are associated with obesity?</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the risks of obesity to your general health like heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes, obesity is also associated with a number of conditions that affect your digestive system, pancreas and liver. Many of the gastrointestinal diseases that are commonly seen in normal weight individuals are seen up to 2 to 3 times more commonly in those who are obese.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Maintaining a healthy weight requires a balance of the calories consumed from foods and beverages with the calories expended through physical activity and normal metabolism. Healthy foods can provide adequate nutrition and an appropriate number of calories and developing healthy eating habits can lead to healthier favorite dishes and reduced calorie-rich temptations.<br>
To promote healthy eating habits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole-grain products.</li>
  <li>Include low-fat or non-fat milk or dairy products.</li>
  <li>Choose lean meats, poultry, fish, lentils, and beans for protein.</li>
  <li>Serve reasonably-sized portions.</li>
  <li>Drink lots of water.</li>
  <li>Limit fruit juice and sodas</li>
  <li>Limit consumption of sugar and saturated fat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that small changes every day can lead to significant benefit over time. In addition to healthy eating, an active lifestyle will help maintain your weight. Choosing to add more physical activity to your day will increase the amount of calories your body burns. This makes it more likely that you'll maintain your weight.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<ul><li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/obesity/" class="faqquestion">How is obesity treated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>A person's motivation, commitment, and compliance are critical for long-term weight loss success - certainly, knowing that weight loss can reduce blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar levels, and many other obesity-associated health risks can be very motivating! The goals of treatment are first to prevent further weight gain, and then to reduce body weight and maintain the lower body weight over the long-term. A number of factors play a role in deciding about the most appropriate treatment of obesity including a person's BMI, waist circumference, associated health conditions, and their motivation to lose weight.</p>
<p>Important facts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Body weight  alone can be used to follow weight loss, and to determine the  effectiveness of a weight loss treatment.</li>
  <li>The initial  goal of weight loss therapy should be to reduce body weight by about 10  percent from baseline over 6 to 12 months.</li>
  <li>To lose  weight, you must use more energy than you take in.</li>
  <li>To improve  long-term success, lose weight gradually (1-2 pounds/week).</li>
  <li>Long-term  behavior modification therapy is necessary for long-term weight loss.</li>
  <li>If unable to  lose weight, prevent further weight gain by exploring your barriers to  weight reduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment generally begins with lower calorie and lower fat meals, increasing physical activity, and incorporating behavioral modification techniques like engaging social support, using stimulus control, and stress management. Medications or surgical management require physician supervision. Before beginning a weight loss program, you should consult with your health care provider to know which of these treatments is right for you. Do make sure your provider is aware if you suffer from chest pains, dizziness or fainting, or if you plan a vigorous program and are over age 40 (men) or 50 (women).</p>
<p><strong><em>Reduced Calorie Diet and Exercise</em></strong></p>
<p>Treatment starts with a combination of a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. Cutting back intake by 500-1000 kcal daily can lead to a 26 to 55 pound weight loss in 6 months, with an average loss of around 26-35 pounds. A difference of one 12-oz. soda (150 calories) or 30 minutes of brisk walking most days can add or subtract approximately 10 pounds to your weight each year. Reducing your calorie intake by 150 calories a day, along with participating in moderate activity, could double your weight loss and is equivalent to approximately 20 pounds in 1 year. Fad diets and very-low calorie diets can result in substantial weight loss rapidly; however, the sustainability of these diets and their long-term benefits and health consequences are not well documented. Consult with your physician for the diet that's right for you.</p>

</table>
<p><strong><em>Behavior Therapy</em></strong><br>
  The importance of behavior modification cannot be stressed enough. <strong>Unless you change the way you think about food and exercise habits, weight loss is unlikely to be maintained over the long-term.</strong> Behavioral strategies to reinforce changes in diet and physical activity can produce a weight loss in the range of 10 percent of baseline weight over 4-12 months. Behavioral strategies include stress management, social support, recording food and calorie intake, and modifying environmental cues that are associated with overeating and inactivity. Commercial weight loss programs that promote these behavioral changes may be useful.</p>
<p><strong><em>Medications</em></strong><br>
When a reduced calorie diet, increased physical activity, and behavior modification are unsuccessful in creating significant sustained weight loss, medications may be helpful in selected patients. Medications may be considered in patients with a BMI of â¥ 30 or in those with a BMI of â¥ 27.5 with concomitant risk factors (e.g., smoking) or obesity-related illnesses (e.g. diabetes, heart disease). At present, two medications are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for long-term use as weight loss aids: Sibutramine and Orlistat. A lower dose form of orlistat is available over-the-counter (Alli). Both orlistat and sibutramine are most effective when taken in conjunction with a low fat/low calorie diet, regular exercise and behavior therapy. There is no convincing evidence to support the use of the so-called "fat burners" that are commonly advertised.</p>
<p><strong><em>Surgery</em></strong><br>
Weight loss surgery is currently the most effective treatment for morbid obesity and the only effective approach for the extremely obese. Weight loss surgery may be an option in carefully selected patients with a BMI of â¥ 40 without obesity-associated health problems and â¥ 35 in those with obesity-associated health problems. Weight loss surgery should be reserved for patients in whom medical efforts have failed and who are suffering the complications of extreme obesity. Currently, the most common surgeries performed are gastric banding and the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) restricts the entrance of food into the lower part of the stomach by placing a tight, adjustable prosthetic band around the entrance to the stomach. The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) both restricts the amount of food comfortably ingested by dividing the stomach and creating a small gastric pouch, and reconfigures the anatomy of the upper small intestine, thereby creating some degree of malabsorption. The RYGB is a much more technically complex operation but can also be performed laparoscopically.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://patients.gi.org/files/2011/08/heart1.png" alt="" width="227" height="235" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154" /><img src="http://patients.gi.org/files/2011/08/heart2.png" alt="" width="200" height="235" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-155" /></p>
<p>These procedures normally result in sustained weight loss between 15% and 40% of total body weight, with a maximum weight loss about 12 months after the operation. The RYGB is more effective than the LAGB at causing sustained weight loss. Importantly, some individuals gain back weight in the long-term, emphasizing the point that the results from these surgical procedures are most effective when combined with a low fat/low calorie diet, regular exercise and behavior modification. An experienced surgeon and participation in an after-care program are recommended to optimize the chance for optimal results. It is also important to recognize that complications and mortality following surgical treatment of severe obesity do occur and vary based upon the procedure performed.</p>

<p>Pain is always abnormal, but it may not be a medical emergency. Mild pain or chronic pain that is not associated with danger signs (âred flags") should be discussed with your doctor when it is convenient. Severe pain or pain that is associated with red flags should be discussed with your doctor; he or she may want you to visit the office or even the emergency room, depending upon your specific complaints. Red flags that should prompt discussion with your doctor include fever, diarrhea, persistent constipation, blood in the stools, persistent nausea or vomiting, vomiting blood, severe tenderness of the belly, jaundice (yellowish discoloration of the skin) or swelling of the abdomen.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/abdominal-pain/" class="faqquestion">What causes abdominal pain?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Pain can arise from any of the structures within the abdomen or the abdominal wall. In addition, pain messages originating in the chest, back, or pelvis can sometimes be perceived as coming from the abdomen.

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/abdominal-pain/" class="faqquestion">How is the cause of abdominal pain determined?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The patientâs history provides the most helpful information that a doctor uses to determine the cause of abdominal pain. The characteristics of the pain (sharp, dull, cramping, burning, twisting, tearing, penetrating), its location and relation to eating or to having a bowel movement are important clues. Additional factors that are useful include the pattern of pain, its duration, radiation (spread) to other areas of the body, and its association with other symptoms, such as jaundice (yellow skin), nausea, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea or constipation.</p>

<p>Findings on physical examination also are helpful. Key findings include areas of tenderness, the presence or absence of bowel sounds or abdominal distention, masses, organ enlargement, and evidence of blood in the stools.</p>

<p>Based on the history and physical examination the doctor may or may not have a clear idea about the cause of pain. Sometimes a diagnosis is made and treatment can be started. In other circumstances diagnostic tests are used to confirm or to exclude a specific diagnosis. Many tests can be ordered for these purposes. Frequently used tests include analysis of blood, urine and stool samples, x-rays of the abdomen, and endoscopy.</p>

<h3>Blood Tests</h3>

<p>Blood tests include complete blood counts (analysis of the numbers of white cells that fight infections, red cells that carry oxygen and that are reduced in anemia, and platelets that help the blood to clot), chemistry tests (liver and kidney tests, blood mineral levels, and enzymes released when organs like the liver or pancreas are injured), and serology tests that measure antibody levels to various infections. Urine tests include urinalysis (measurement of characteristics and chemicals in urine along with microscopic inspection of a drop of urine), and urine culture for bacterial infection. Stools can be analyzed for blood and pus (markers of inflammation, infections, or tumors), fat (evidence of impaired digestion and absorption of food), and the presence of germs.</p>

<h3>X-ray and Imaging Tests</h3>

<p>Many different kinds of x-ray and imaging tests are used to make pictures of the interior of the body. These include barium studies in which barium sulfate (a material that shows up on x-rays) is swallowed (barium swallow, upper gastrointestinal series, small bowel follow-through examination) or injected by a tube into the small intestine (enteroclysis) or colon (barium enema). Computerized tomography (CT scan) is a very sophisticated technique for reconstructing cross-sectional x-ray images of the body with the help of a computer. Magnetic resonance imaging is a similar technique in which radio waves and magnets are used to make pictures of the internal organs. Sonography uses high frequency sound waves to peer into the body and to visualize the internal structures. Nuclear medicine scans use isotopes to identify body parts and to examine their function.</p>

<h3>Endoscopy</h3>

<p>Endoscopy involves the use of special instruments to look into the hollow organs of the digestive tract. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy uses a flexible tube with a television camera in its tip and a lighting system to examine the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (the part of the intestine just beyond the stomach). Special tools can be passed through the tube to remove polyps or to obtain biopsy specimens to be viewed under a microscope. Longer tubes can reach well into the small intestine and similar tubes can be introduced through the rectum to view the colon (colonoscopy). Special endoscopes have been designed to look at the bile ducts and pancreatic duct and to obtain sonograms from inside the gut ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) and EUS (Endoscopic Ultrasound), respectively). Another diagnostic test is capsule endoscopy in which a capsule containing a tiny camera, broadcasting station and antenna sends pictures to a special belt that is worn around the abdomen. Pictures can be obtained from throughout the small intestine as the device is propelled through the gut.</p>

<p>While the technology behind these tests is impressive, a cause for abdominal pain can be made in most patients by means of a history, physical examination, and a few simple tests. Every patient does not require a full panel of diagnostic tests.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<ul><li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/abdominal-pain/" class="faqquestion">What treatments are available for abdominal pain?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Once a diagnosis is made, treatment can proceed for that condition. Sometimes medications are used to reduce inflammation or affect the function of an organ, thereby relieving pain. For example, ulcers can be treated by taking medications that reduce stomach acid secretion. As the ulcer heals, pain is reduced. Sometimes an operation is needed to correct a problem. For example, pain due to cholecystitis (inflammation of the gall bladder) is usually treated by removal of the gall bladder (cholecystectomy).</p>

<p>Occasionally, pain must be treated with drugs that reduce pain (analgesics). Simple analgesics like aspirin and ibuprofen should not be used ordinarily for undiagnosed abdominal pain because they may cause other problems, such as ulcers. Narcotic drugs are sometimes prescribed by doctors for abdominal pain, but their use can lead to constipation and other abdominal symptoms. Another approach is to use pain-modifying drugs to change the way that pain signals are processed in the spinal cord and brain. The drugs used most commonly for this purpose are antidepressant drugs, like amitriptyline or trazodone, that can be taken in very low doses that minimize side effects and have little or no antidepressant effects. In some cases pain management physicians use nerve blocks to identify and treat the mechanism of pain.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/acid-reflux/" class="faqquestion">How common is heartburn?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p> More than 60  million Americans experience heartburn at least once a month and some studies  have suggested that more than 15 million Americans experience heartburn  symptoms each day. Symptoms of heartburn, also known as acid indigestion, are  more common among the elderly and pregnant women.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/acid-reflux/" class="faqquestion">What is heartburn or GERD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Gastroesophageal  reflux is a physical condition in which acid from the stomach flows backward up  into the esophagus. People will experience heartburn symptoms when excessive  amounts of acid reflux into the esophagus. Many describe heartburn as a feeling  of burning discomfort, localized behind the breastbone, that moves up toward  the neck and throat. Some even experience the bitter or sour taste of the acid  in the back of the throat. The burning and pressure symptoms of heartburn can  last for several hours and often worsen after eating food. All of us may have  occasional heartburn. However, frequent heartburn (two or more times a week),  food sticking, blood or weight loss may be associated with a more severe  problem known as gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/acid-reflux/" class="faqquestion">What causes heartburn and GERD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>To understand gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD, it is first necessary to  understand what causes heartburn. Most people will experience heartburn if the  lining of the esophagus comes in contact with too much stomach juice for too  long a period of time. This stomach juice consists of acid, digestive enzymes,  and other injurious materials. The prolonged contact of acidic stomach juice  with the esophageal lining injures the esophagus and produces a burning  discomfort. Normally, a muscular valve at the lower end of the esophagus called  the lower esophageal sphincter or âLESâ â keeps the acid in the stomach and out  of the esophagus. In gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD, the LES relaxes  too frequently, which allows stomach acid to reflux, or flow backward into the esophagus.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/acid-reflux/" class="faqquestion">What are the treatments for  infrequent heartburn?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>In many  cases, doctors find that infrequent heartburn can be controlled by lifestyle  modifications and proper use of over-the-counter medicines.</p>
<h3>Lifestyle Modifications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid  foods and beverages that contribute to heartburn: chocolate, coffee,  peppermint, greasy or spicy foods, tomato products and alcoholic beverages.</li>
<li>Stop  smoking. Tobacco inhibits saliva, which is the body's major buffer. Tobacco may  also stimulate stomach acid production and relax the muscle between the  esophagus and the stomach, permitting acid reflux to occur.</li>
<li> Reduce  weight if too heavy.</li>
<li>Do not eat  2-3 hours before sleep.</li>
<li>For  infrequent episodes of heartburn, take an over-the-counter antacid or an H2  blocker, some of which are now available without a prescription.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Over-the-Counter Medications</h3>
<p>Large numbers of Americans use over-the-counter  antacids and other agents that are available without a prescription to treat  minor GI discomforts and infrequent heartburn.Â   In 1995, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the  non-prescription availability of important acid blockers, also called H2  blockers, for treatment of infrequent heartburn with dosage levels below the  prescription strength formulations.Â  It  is anticipated that the FDA will approve the non-prescription availability of  another distinct class of drugs, known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), for  the treatment of infrequent heartburn, also at dosage levels below the  prescription strength formulations.Â   While these reduced strength formulations have been approved for relief  of symptoms/discomfort from occasional heartburn, they are not recognized by  FDA as promoting actual healing of esophagitis, whereas FDA does recognize the  healing benefits of some prescription strength medications, e.g. proton pump  inhibitors, when taken regularly at prescription dosages. </p>
<p>Over-the-counter medications have a significant  role in providing relief from heartburn and other occasional GI discomforts.  More frequent episodes of heartburn or acid indigestion may be a symptom of a  more serious condition that could worsen if not treated. If you are using an  over-the-counter product more than twice a week, you should consult a physician  who can confirm a specific diagnosis and develop a treatment plan with you,  including the use of stronger medicines that are only available with a  prescription. </p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/acid-reflux/" class="faqquestion">Why are heartburn and GERD not  trivial conditions?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>When  symptoms of heartburn are not controlled with modifications in lifestyle, and  over-the-counter medicines are needed two or more times a week, or symptoms remain  unresolved on the medication you are taking, you should see your doctor. You  may have GERD.</p>
<p>When GERD is  not treated, serious complications can occur, such as severe chest pain that  can mimic a heart attack, esophageal stricture (a narrowing or obstruction of  the esophagus), bleeding, or a pre-malignant change in the lining of the  esophagus called Barrett's esophagus.Â  A  1999 study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that patients  with chronic, untreated heartburn of many years duration were at substantially  greater risk of developing esophageal cancer, which is one of the fastest  growing, and among the more lethal forms of cancer in this country.</p>
<p>Symptoms suggesting that serious damage may have already occurred include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dysphagia: difficulty swallowing or a feeling that food is trapped behind the breast bone.</li>
<li>Bleeding: vomiting blood, or having tarry, black bowel movements.</li>
<li>Choking: sensation of acid refluxed into the windpipe causing shortness of breath,  coughing, or hoarseness of the voice.</li>
<li>Weight Loss</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/acid-reflux/" class="faqquestion">What are the treatment goals for  GERD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>GERD is a  problem that is symptomatic by day but in which much damage is done by night.  Treatment should be designed to: 1) eliminate symptoms; 2) heal esophagitis;  and 3) prevent the relapse of esophagitis or development of complications in  patients with esophagitis.Â  In many patients,  GERD is a chronic, relapsing disease. Long-term maintenance is the key to  therapy; therefore, continuous long-term therapy, possibly life-long therapy,  to control symptoms and prevent complications is appropriate. Maintenance  therapy will vary in individuals ranging from mere lifestyle modifications to  prescription medication as treatment.</p>
<p>All  treatments are based on attempts to a) decrease the amount of acid that  refluxes from the stomach back into the esophagus, or b) make the refluxed  material less irritating to the lining of the esophagus.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/acid-reflux/" class="faqquestion">What are the treatments for GERD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<h3>Lifestyle Modification</h3>
<p>In order to  decrease the amount of gastric contents that reach the lower esophagus, certain  simple guidelines should be followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raise the Head of the Bed. The simplest method is to use a 4" x 4" piece of  wood to which two jar caps have been nailed an appropriate distance apart to  receive the legs or casters at the upper end of the bed. Failure to use the jar  caps inevitably results in the patient being jolted from sleep as the upper end  of the bed rolls off the 4" x 4".
<p>Alternatively, one may use an under-mattress foam wedge to elevate the head about 6-10 inches.  Pillows are not an effective alternative for elevating the head in preventing  reflux.</p></li>
<li>Change  Eating and Sleeping Habits. Avoid lying down for two hours after eating. Do not  eat for at least two hours before bedtime. This decreases the amount of stomach  acid available for reflux.</li>
<li>Avoid  Tight Clothing. Reduce your weight if obesity contributes to the problem.</li>
<li>Change  Your Diet. Avoid foods and medications that lower LES tone (fats and chocolate)  and foods that may irritate the damaged lining of the esophagus (citrus juice,  tomato juice, and probably pepper).</li>
<li>Curtail  Habits That Contribute to GERD. Both smoking and the use of alcoholic beverages  lower LES pressure, which contributes to acid reflux.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Medical Treatment of GERD</h3>
<p>GERD has a  physical cause, and frequently is not curtailed by these lifestyle factors  alone. If you are using over-the-counter medications two or more times a week,  or are still having symptoms on the prescription or other medicines you are  taking, you need to see your doctor. If results are not forthcoming,  medications may be used to neutralize acid, increase LES tone, or improve  gastric emptying.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/acid-reflux/" class="faqquestion">What are the medications often  prescribed for GERD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Prescription  medications to treat GERD include drugs called H2 receptor antagonists (H2  blockers) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which help to reduce the stomach  acid that tends to worsen symptoms, and work to promote healing, as well as  promotility agents that aid in the clearance of acid from the esophagus.</p>
<h3>H2 Receptor Antagonists</h3>
<p>Since the  mid 1970's, acid suppression agents, known as H2 receptor antagonists or H2  blockers, have been used to treat GERD.Â   H2 blockers improve the symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation and  provide an excellent means of decreasing the flow of stomach acid to aid in the  healing process of mild-to-moderate irritation of the esophagus, known as  "esophagitis."Â  Symptoms are eliminated  in up to 50% of patients with twice a day prescription dosage of the H2  blockers. Healing of esophagitis may require higher dosing.Â  These agents maintain remission in about 25%  of patients.</p>
<p>H2 blockers  are generally less expensive than proton pump inhibitors and can provide  adequate initial treatment or serve as a maintenance agent in GERD patients  with mild symptoms. Current treatment guidelines also recognize the  appropriateness and in some cases desirability of using proton pump inhibitors  as first-line therapy for some patients, particularly those with more severe  symptoms or esophagitis on endoscopy.Â   Proton pump inhibitors will be required to achieve effective long-term  maintenance therapy in a significant percentage of heartburn/GERD patients.</p>
<h3>Proton Pump lnhibitors</h3>
<p>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), have been found to  heal erosive esophagitis (a serious form of GERD) more rapidly than H2  blockers.Â  Proton pump inhibitors provide  not only symptom relief, but also elimination of symptoms in most cases, even  in those with esophageal ulcers.Â  Studies  have shown proton pump inhibitor therapy can provide complete endoscopic  mucosal healing of esophagitis at 6 to 8 weeks in 75% to 100% of cases.Â  Although healing of the esophagus may occur  in 6 to 8 weeks, it should not be misunderstood that gastroesophageal reflux  can be cured in that amount of time. The goal of therapy for GERD is to keep  symptoms comfortably under control and prevent complications. As noted above,  current guidelines recognize that heartburn and GERD are typically relapsing,  potentially chronic conditions, that symptoms and mucosal injury will often  reoccur when medications are withdrawn, and hence that a strategy for long-term  maintenance therapy is generally required. Occasionally, a health care plan  seeks to limit use of proton pump inhibitors to a fixed duration of perhaps 2-3  months and others have even cited FDA's approval of proton pump inhibitors for  up to one year, as if that means that this therapy should be withdrawn after  one year. There is no well-established scientific reason that supports  withdrawing proton pump inhibitors after one year as these patients will  invariably relapse. All gastroenterologists have patients who continue to do  very well on proton pump inhibitors after many years' use without adverse side  effects. Efforts by payors to limit access  to these medications are generally a cost-saving initiative. Daily proton pump  inhibitor treatment provides the best long-term maintenance therapy of  esophagitis, particularly in keeping symptoms and the disease in remission for  those patients with moderate to severe esophagitis, plus this form of treatment  has been shown to retain remission for up to five years.</p>
<h3>Promotility Agents</h3>
<p>Promotility  drugs are effective in the treatment of mild to moderately symptomatic GERD.  These drugs increase lower esophageal sphincter pressure, which helps prevent  acid reflux, and improves the movement of food from the stomach. They can  decrease heartburn symptoms, especially at night, by improving the clearance of  acid from the esophagus. Recent developments have greatly limited the  availability of one of these agents, i.e. cisapride. Cisapride had been used  widely for several years in treating night-time heartburn and was also used by  some practitioners in the treatment of GERD symptoms in children. More  recently, rare but potentially serious complications have been reported in some  patients taking cisapride. These complications seem to be related to usage in  patients on contraindicated medications or in patients with contraindicated  medical conditions, such as underlying heart disease. In March of 2000, the  manufacturer announced that it had reached a decision in consultation with the  FDA to discontinue the marketing of the drug. The product will remain available  only through a limited-access program. This program has been established for  patients who fail other treatment options and who meet clearly defined  eligibility criteria.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/acid-reflux/" class="faqquestion">Can surgery be an option when medical  treatments for GERD fail?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Surgical  measures to prevent reflux can be considered if other measures fail or  complications occur such as bleeding, recurrent stricture, or metaplasia  (abnormal transformation of cells lining the esophagus), which is progressive.  The surgical technique improves the natural barrier between the stomach and the  esophagus that prevents acid reflux from occurring. Consultation with both a  gastroenterologist and a surgeon is recommended prior to such a decision.</p>
<p>There are  always new treatments and possibilities looming on the horizon. There are two  new endoscopic techniques for treating GERD â suturing and the Stretta radio  frequency technique â which have recently been approved by the FDA for use with  patients. Because these treatments are so new, we do not have any real  information concerning their long-term effectiveness. They were approved by the  FDA largely based on data showing that they could help reduce GERD for at least  six months after treatment. At least in the foreseeable future, until long-term  outcomes can be evaluated, most patients and physicians will likely be sticking  with the treatment options about which there is a much greater wealth of  experience, e.g. medical treatment with proton pump inhibitors and other acid  suppression medications, and surgery.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/acid-reflux/" class="faqquestion">What is a Gastroenterologist?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>A  gastroenterologist is a physician who specializes in disorders and conditions  of the gastrointestinal tract. Most gastroenterologists are board-certified in  this subspecialty. After completing the same training as all other physicians,  they first complete at least two years of additional training in order to  attain board certification in internal medicine, then gastroenterologists study  for an additional 2-3 years to train specifically in conditions of the  gastrointestinal tract.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/acid-reflux/" class="faqquestion">What types of tests are needed to  evaluate GERD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Your doctor  or gastroenterologist may wish to evaluate your symptoms with additional tests  when it is unclear whether your symptoms are caused by acid reflux, or if you  suffer from complications of GERD such as dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing),  bleeding, choking, or if your symptoms fail to improve with prescription  medications. Your doctor may decide to conduct one or more of the following  tests.</p>
<h3>Upper GI  Series</h3>
<p>For the  upper GI series, you will be asked to swallow a liquid barium mixture  (sometimes called a "barium meal"). The radiologist uses a fluoroscope to watch  the barium as it travels down your esophagus and into the stomach.</p>
<p>You will be  asked to move into various positions on the X-ray table while the radiologist  watches the GI tract. Permanent pictures (X-ray films) will be made as needed.</p>
<h3>Endoscopy</h3>
<p>This test  involves passing a small lighted flexible tube through the mouth into the  esophagus and stomach to examine for abnormalities. The test is usually  performed with the aid of sedatives. It is the best test to identify  esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus.</p>
<h3>Esophageal  Manometry or Esophageal pH</h3>
This test  involves passing a small flexible tube through the nose into the esophagus and  stomach in order to measure pressures and function of the esophagus. Also, the  degree of acid refluxed into the esophagus can be measured over 24 hours.</p>
<p>Extra-Esophageal  Manifestations (EEM): Heartburn links to chest pain; asthma; chronic cough;  ear, nose and throat problems often avoid detection</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/acid-reflux/" class="faqquestion">GERD can masquerade as other diseases</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Increasingly,  we are becoming aware that the irritation and damage to the esophagus from  continual presence of acid can prompt an entire array of symptoms other than  simple heartburn.Â  Experts recognize that  often the role of acid reflux has been overlooked as a potential factor in the  diagnosis and treatment of patients with chronic cough, hoarseness and  asthma-like symptoms. In some instances, patients have never reported  heartburn, and in others the potential causal link between reflux and the onset  of these so-called "extra-esophageal manifestations" has not been fully  recognized. Physicians are increasingly becoming aware that it is good clinical  practice to evaluate the possible presence of reflux in patients with chronic  cough and asthma-like symptoms, as well as the importance that acid suppression  and treating underlying reflux can have in potentially improving the symptoms  in these patients.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chest  Pain: Patients with GERD may have chest pain similar to angina or heart pain.  Usually, they also have other symptoms like heartburn and acid regurgitation.  If your doctor says your chest pain is not coming from the heart, don't forget  the esophagus. On the other hand, if you have chest pain, you should not assume  it is your esophagus until you have been evaluated for a potential heart cause  by your physician.</li>
<li>Asthma:  Acid reflux may aggravate asthma. Recent studies suggest that the majority of  asthmatics have acid reflux. Clues that GERD may be worsening your asthma  include: 1) asthma that appears for the first time during adulthood; 2) asthma  that gets worse after meals, lying down or exercise; and 3) asthma that is  mainly at night. Treatment of acid reflux may cure asthma in some patients and  decrease the need for asthmatic medications in others.</li>
<li>Ear, Nose  and Throat Problems: Acid reflux may be a cause of chronic cough, sore throat,  laryngitis with hoarseness, frequent throat clearing, or growths on the vocal  cords. If these problems do not get better with standard treatments, think  about GERD.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/acid-reflux/" class="faqquestion">Patients with longstanding GERD can  experience severe complications</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<ul>
<li>Peptic  Stricture: This results from chronic acid injury and scarring of the lower  esophagus. Patients complain of food sticking in the lower esophagus. Heartburn  symptoms may actually lessen as the esophageal opening narrows down preventing  acid reflux. Stretching of the esophagus and proton pump inhibitor medication  are needed to control and prevent peptic strictures.</li>
<li>Barrett's  Esophagus: A serious complication of chronic GERD is Barrett's esophagus. Here  the lining of the esophagus changes to resemble the intestine. Patients may  complain of less heartburn with Barrett's esophagus â that's the good news.  Unfortunately, this is a pre-cancerous condition: patients with Barrett's  esophagus have approximately a 30-fold increased risk of developing esophageal  cancer. These patients should be followed by endoscopy by a trained  gastroenterologist familiar with this disease.</li>
<li>Esophageal  Cancer: Recent scientific reports have confirmed that if GERD is left untreated  for many years, it could lead to this most serious complication â Barrett's  esophagus and esophageal cancer. Frequent heartburn symptoms with a duration of  several years cannot simply be dismissed â there can be severe consequences of  delaying diagnosis and treatment. This increased risk of chronic, longstanding  GERD sufferers to develop cancer demonstrates the true severity of heartburn.  In patients with chronic heartburn, an endoscopy will often be recommended to  visually monitor the condition of the lining of the esophagus and identify or  confirm the absence of any suspicious or pre-malignant lesions, such as  Barrett's esophagus. So, do not ignore your heartburn. If you are having  heartburn two or more times a week, it is time to see your physician and in all  likelihood a gastrointestinal specialist.Â   In most cases an endoscopy should be performed to evaluate the severity  of GERD and identify the possible presence of the pre-malignant condition â  Barrett's esophagus.Â  The preventative  strategy is to treat GERD.Â  If it goes  untreated and cancer does develop, the survival rate for esophageal cancer, at  this time, is dismal.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/acid-reflux/" class="faqquestion">Ignoring persistent heartburn  symptoms can lead to severe consequences</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<h3>Study links duration of heartburn to severity  of esophageal disease</h3>
<p>Esophageal  disease may be perceived in many forms, with heartburn being the most common.  The severity of heartburn is measured by how long a given episode lasts, how  often symptoms occur, and/or their intensity. Since the esophageal lining is  sensitive to stomach contents, persistent and prolonged exposure to these  contents may cause changes such as inflammation, ulcers, bleeding and scarring  with obstruction. A pre-cancerous condition called Barrett's esophagus may also  occur. Barrett's esophagus causes severe damage to the lining of the esophagus  when the body attempts to protect the esophagus from acid by replacing its  normal lining with cells that are similar to the intestinal lining.</p>
<p>Research was  conducted to determine whether the duration of heartburn symptoms increases the  risk of having esophageal complications. The study found that inflammation in  the esophagus not only increased with the duration of reflux symptoms, but that  Barrett's esophagus likewise was more frequently diagnosed in these patients.  Those patients with reflux symptoms and a history of inflammation in the past  were more likely to have Barrett's esophagus than those without a history of  esophageal inflammation. </p>
<h3>Study links chronic heartburn to esophageal  cancer</h3>
Over the  past 20 years, the incidence of esophageal cancer, a highly fatal form of  cancer, has rapidly increased in the United States. A recent research study has  linked chronic, longstanding, untreated heartburn with an increased risk of  developing esophageal cancer. As reported by Lagergren et al. in the study that  was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, patients who experienced  chronic, unresolved heartburn markedly increase the risk of esophageal cancer,  a rare but often deadly malignancy. According to the study, the incidence of  adenocarcinoma of the esophagus was nearly eight times more likely among  frequent heartburn sufferers (two times a week or more) compared to individuals  without symptoms, while among patients with longstanding, severe and unresolved  heartburn (e.g. frequent symptoms 20 years duration), the risk of developing  esophageal cancer was 43.5 times as great as for those without chronic  heartburn.</p>
<p>Persistent symptoms of heartburn and reflux  should not be ignored. By seeing your doctor early, the physical cause of GERD  can be treated and more serious problems avoided.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<ul>
<li>Heartburn  is a common, but not trivial condition.<br>
In fact, if  left untreated, longstanding, severe and chronic heartburn has been linked with  esophageal cancer. Don't ignore frequent heartburn â instead consult with your  physician regarding an endoscopy and treatment to achieve early symptom  resolution.</li>
<li>If you  suffer infrequent heartburn, antacids, or H2 blockers (now available without a  prescription) or proton pump inhibitors (pending release at reduced strength  over-the-counter dosages) may provide the relief you need.</li>
<li>If you are  experiencing heartburn two or more times a week, you may have acid reflux  disease, also known as GERD, which, if left untreated, is potentially serious.</li>
<li>If you are  self-medicating for heartburn two or more times a week, or if you still have  symptoms on your over-the-counter or prescription medication, you need to see a  doctor and perhaps be referred to a gastroenterologist.</li>
<li>GERD has a  physical cause that's not your fault and can only be treated by a physician.</li>
<li>If left  untreated, longstanding, severe and chronic heartburn/GERD has been linked with  esophageal cancer.Â  Don't ignore frequent  heartburn â instead consult with your physician regarding an endoscopy and  treatment to achieve early symptom resolution.</li>
<li>GERD has a  significant role in asthma, chronic cough and  ear, nose and throat problems â all referred to as extra-esophageal  manifestations (EEM) although this connection may often go unrecognized. GERD  should be actively considered in physician evaluations of these conditions, or  it could go undetected.</li>
<li>With effective treatment, using the range of  prescription medications and other treatments available today, you can become  symptom free, avoid potential complications and restore the quality of life you  deserve.</li>

<h3>Measure Yourself on the Richter Scale/Acid Test</h3>
<p>How  significant is your heartburn? What are the chances that it is something more  serious? If you need a yardstick, here's a simple self-test developed by a  panel of experts from the American College of Gastroenterology.</p>
<p>Remember, if  you have heartburn two or more times a week, or still have symptoms on your  over-the-counter or prescription medicines, see your doctor.</p>
<p>Take this  "Richter Scale/Acid Test" to see if you're a GERD sufferer and are taking the  right stepsÂ  to treat it.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Do you frequently have one or more  of the following:</strong>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>an uncomfortable feeling behind the  breastbone that seems to be moving upward from the stomach?</li>
  <li>a burning sensation in the back of your  throat?</li>
  <li>a bitter acid taste in your mouth?</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Do you often experience these problems after meals?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do you experience heartburn or acid indigestion two or more times per  week?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do you find that antacids only provide  temporary relief from your symptoms?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Are you taking prescription  medication to treat heartburn, but still having symptoms?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you said  yes to two or more of the above, you may have GERD. To know for sure, see your  doctor or a gastrointestinal specialist. They can help you live pain free.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">What is GERD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition where acid in the stomach sweeps up into  the esophagus causing unpleasant symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation and  unpleasant taste of acid in the mouth (water brash). This can also cause  serious symptoms such as chest pain mimicking heart attack, hoarseness, asthma  like symptoms thus causing unwanted anxiety in the patient, an undesirable  hospital stay and unnecessary medical expenditures.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">Why do we have acid in the stomach?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Acid  in the stomach is the first line of defense against the food-borne pathogens  that we ingest. Moreover acid in the stomach plays a role in absorption of  vitamins (Vitamin B12), the digestion of proteins, and initiation of  peristalsis which causes the food to move through the digestive tract.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">What are the risk factors for GERD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Advancing  age, obesity, regular use of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,  loss of physical mobility, and an incompetent valve between the stomach and  esophagus (Lower Esophageal Sphincter or LES) are found to be among the many associated  risk factors for GERD.</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">How does aging affect GERD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>About  8% of males and 15% of females over 65 years suffer from GERD and potentially  use an acid medication. Aging by itself can cause changes in the pressure of  the LES, which may increase the risk of GERD in the elderly. Decreased physical  mobility secondary to multiple medical problems including arthritis increases  the risk of becoming overweight and increase the risk of GERD. Many take aspirin  or other medications that may contribute to the increased occurrence of GERD symptoms  in the elderly. Aging also decreases the force of swallowing contractions,  which causes delayed clearance of acid when refluxed into the esophagus.Â Thus there is potential for increased  exposure of the esophageal lining to the regurgitated acid and thus increases  the risk of damage.</p></div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">What tests may your physician offer to diagnose GERD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<ol type="a">
<li><em>EGD (Esophago-Gastro-Duodenoscopy)</em> ââ This test is also called an upper endoscopy or gastroscopy.  For this test you will be given medicine to make you sleepy. A small tube is then inserted through the mouth, down into the esophagus and then through the stomach into the first part of your small bowel. The test only takes about 15 minutes but can give a lot of information about whether you have an ulcer, inflammation in your stomach and esophagus, and whether you might have a cancer or a narrowing of your esophagus.</li>
<li><em>Swallowing Test</em> ââ This is an X-ray that evaluates how your  esophagus works. You will swallow a dilute solution of barium (a dye to  visualize the esophagus in X-ray) and photographs are taken as you swallow.  This can be very helpful in determining where the problem might be in your  esophagus.</li>
<li><em>Manometry Study</em> ââ This test diagnoses whether you have a  problem with the way your esophagus squeezes, and finds out the condition of  your LES.</li>
</ol>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">How do we treat GERD in the elderly?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The  management guideline for GERD in the elderly remains the same as in a young  patient. However, the physician may individualize the treatment based on the  patient's overall condition.Â The  treatment can be broadly classified into lifestyle modifications, over-the-counter  medications and prescribed medications.</p>
<p>Lifestyle modifications include raising the head  end of the bed to use gravity as a leverage to allow early clearance of  regurgitated acid from the esophagus. Avoiding tight fitting clothes to  decrease abdominal pressure, decrease fats, chocolate, peppermint and alcohol  from the diet to try to help reduce  reflux.</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">What are the medications used for treatment of GERD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Mild  reflux symptoms can be controlled by over-the-counter medications like antacids  such as TUMS<sup>Â®</sup> and Pepto-Bismol<sup>Â®</sup>, which neutralize the  acids. This is only effective in 20% of the patients. They have to be taken  frequently after meals (such as 1-3 hours). One of the main disadvantages is  the inability of these products to heal any areas of esophageal inflammation  caused by the acid reflux.</p>
<p>Antacids  contain aluminum and magnesium which can cause constipation and diarrhea in  some patients. Constipation occurs in fewer than 2 percent of persons in the  nonelderly population but affects as many as 26 percent of men and 34 percent  of women over 65 years of age. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)  should be careful with these medications as the mineral ingredients may worsen  kidney function. You consult with your care provider if you have CKD.</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">What is an H2 blocker?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Another  class of anti-reflux medications is histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2  blockers). Cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine, are available over-the-counter.  Although they act more slowly compared to antacids, they remain active longer  compared to the latter. There are combination H2blocker/antacids which may be  helpful in symptom relief.</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">What are the side effects of H2 Blockers?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Cimetidine  and ranitidine may increase the blood concentrations of anti-seizure  medications, blood thinners, and anti-arrhythmic medications. Newer generations  of this class of drugs do not cause this problem.</p>
<p>If the symptoms of GERD persist even after using these medications for more than two weeks, you should consult your doctor.</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">What is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>A proton  pump inhibitor is a medication that is designed to decrease the amount of acid  your stomach makes by inhibiting both meal stimulated and night-time acid  secretion and has better effect than H2 blockers. This type of medication is  also better at healing ulcers in the esophagus and stomach.</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">What are the side-effects of a PPI?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>PPIs  are mostly well tolerated. The only known contraindication is very rare allergy  to this drug group. The most commonly noted side effects are headache, nausea,  diarrhea, abdominal pain and in some cases constipation. Very few persons need  to stop taking the medication because of side-effects.</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">How long should I take this type of medicine?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>This  really depends on the severity of your symptoms and response to therapy. For  example mild cases may respond to treatment and therapy can be stopped after a  short course of treatment. If you have inflammation of the esophagus  (esophagitis) or ulcers in the esophagus/stomach you may need to continue  treatment for a longer period of time and remain on maintenance therapy. When  elderly patients with reflux esophagitis were followed up for a period of 3  years, 68% of them needed treatment for more than six months and 46% needed  therapy for 3 years to prevent recurrence of esophagitis. Without the therapy  80-90% of the patients suffered a relapse in a period of one year.</p></div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">I take clopidogrel, can I take a PPI?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There  have been many studies addressing this issue because of concern of an  interaction between PPIs and Clopidogrel.Â Current data suggests that it is safe to use a PPI and Clopidogrel  together in patients who need both compounds.Â It is possible that some PPIs will have less effect on interactions with  Clopidogrel and this may affect which of the PPIs your care provider will prescribe.  Some PPIs have label recommendations regarding their use with Clopidogrel.Â Please discuss this with your care provider.</p></div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">I have osteoporosis, can I take a PPI? Does it mean that I will have an increased risk of a hip fracture if I do take it?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>It  has been suggested that people who take a PPI for a long period of time at high  doses have an increased risk for fractures of the hip, wrist and spine.Â No evidence exists to suggest that PPIs cause  or accelerate osteoporosis.Â If there is  an increased risk of fractures on PPI it is in patients who are at increased  risk because of other conditions predisposing to osteoporosis and fractures. </p>
<p>The  FDA however, released a warning that doctors and those who take PPIs should be  aware of the possible increased risk of fractures.Â If there is an increased risk of fracture,  the overall risk is extremely small. </p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">I have a low vitamin B12 can I take a PPI?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There  has long been a concern that there might be a very gradual decrease in vitamin  B12 levels over a long time in persons who take a PPI but there has not been  any report of disease being caused by this. There are usually other reasons for  a low vitamin B12 in older persons. There is no need to monitor vitamin B12  levels in persons taking a PPI unless they have another condition.</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">Does acid suppression by PPI/H2 blockers increase the incidence of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> associated diarrhea?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Available  data are controversial but raise concern for an association between these  medicines and <em>C. difficile</em> infection (a colon infection that usually happens  after taking certain antibiotics). The risk is perhaps related to the degree  and duration of acid suppression, other conditions increasing susceptibility of  the patient to this infection and nature and strength of the strain of <em>C.  difficile</em> infection. </p>
<p>This association should prompt the physicians to  use PPI/H2 blockers in patients, specifically older patients on multiple  medications and on frequent antibiotics for recurrent infections, only in those  who need them.
</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gi-health-and-disease/gerd-and-the-elderly/" class="faqquestion">Does use of PPI/H2 blockers increase the incidence of pneumonia in the elderly?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>This  is another area of controversy with perhaps a slight increase in the incidence  of pneumonia in some patients who use PPIs. This risk has been shown to be more  likely with initiation and recent use of an acid-suppressive agent rather than  chronic treatment.</p>
<p>It  is true that the PPI/H2 blockers may decrease the acidic environment in the gut  facilitating the existence of some pathological bacteria that may lead to  pneumonia. When you have reflux, however, it may be that your reflux is  responsible for the problem and not the medication.Â  </p>
<p>Please consult with your care provider if you  have any questions.</p>

What is the Small Bowel?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The small bowel (or small intestine) is the longest portion of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It is called "small" because it is thin or narrow compared to the "large" bowel (also known as the colon), but it is much longer than the large bowel (14 feet on average). The small intestine is a vital organ involved in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://s3.gi.org/patients/gihealth/images/smallbowel.gif" alt="" width="263" height="278" /></p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/capsule-endoscopy/" class="faqquestion">What is Small Bowel Bleeding?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>GI bleeding, including from the small bowel, occurs when an abnormality on the inner lining begins to bleed. The bleeding may be slow, resulting in anemia (a low blood count), or it may be rapid, causing a hemorrhage. Approximately 5% of all GI bleeding comes from the small bowel. In many cases, the abnormalities causing the bleeding lie within reach of a standard endoscope (see below). However, because of the length of the small bowel and its location between the stomach and colon, finding the source of bleeding can be difficult.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/capsule-endoscopy/" class="faqquestion">What causes bleeding from the small bowel?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The causes of bleeding in the small bowel are different from those in the colon or the stomach. The most frequent causes of bleeding from the colon are polyps, diverticulosis (small out-pouchings in the wall of the colon), or cancer. Upper GI (esophagus, stomach, or duodenum) bleeding is most frequently due to ulcers. Unlike the colon and the upper GI tract, however, 30 to 40% of small bowel blood loss is caused by abnormal blood vessels that lie within the wall of the small bowel. These abnormal blood vessels are called angioectasias or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). AVMs become more common as people age and are associated with other medical problems, such as chronic kidney disease and valvular heart disease. In people over the age of 50, AVMs are the most common cause of small bowel bleeding. Other causes of small bowel bleeding include benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) tumors, polyps, Crohn's disease (a type of inflammatory bowel disease), and ulcers. Like ulcers in the stomach, ulcers in the small bowel are often the result of the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) .</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/capsule-endoscopy/" class="faqquestion">How is the small bowel examined?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>There are multiple techniques for evaluating the small bowel.  In most cases, the first step is endoscopy and/or enteroscopy.  If that fails to find the source of bleeding, a common next step is capsule endoscopy.  X-ray options include a small bowel follow-through, or a computed tomographic scan (also known as a CT or CAT scan) of the small bowel.  Deep small bowel enteroscopy can now be preformed using special scopes with inflatable balloons and/or overtubes.   The final option, which is usually used only if other methods have failed, is intraoperative enteroscopy.  All of these methods will be discussed in detail below.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/capsule-endoscopy/" class="faqquestion">What are standard endoscopy and enteroscopy?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Endoscopes and enteroscopes are instruments used by doctors to evaluate the stomach and small bowel.  Endoscopy refers to the examination of the bowel using a scope.  At times the term is used specifically to indicate a procedure using a standard upper endoscope, but it can also be used more broadly to include examinations done with any type of scope.  Endoscopes and enteroscopes resemble long, thin tubes with a light and a camera at one end.  The images obtained are displayed on a monitor.  The scopes also have channels which allow instruments to be passes down them.  These instruments can be used to treat lesions, to obtain biopsies, or to mark the location of a lesion with a tattoo to aid a surgeon in locating it.</p>

<p>The examination begins with the patient receiving a sedative.  The doctor then passes the scope through the mouth.  A regular endoscope is capable of examining the esophagus, stomach and the first portion of the small bowel, known as the duodenum.  In cases where the source of bleeding is thought to be lower down in the small bowel, a longer scope, known as an enteroscope, can be used.  This scope is capable of reaching the middle portion of the small bowel, known as the jejunum.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/capsule-endoscopy/" class="faqquestion">What types of x-ray studies are used to find the source of small bowel bleeding?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>X-ray studies continue to have a role in the evaluation of small bowel bleeding, as 20-25% of bleeding episodes that originate in the small bowel are caused by abnormalities in the intestinal wall, such as tumors, that can be seen by standard or specialized x-ray studies.  There are three x-ray tests commonly used in the evaluation of the small bowel â small bowel follow-through, enteroclysis, and CT enterography.</p>

<p>The small bowel follow-through test is a series of abdominal x-rays that are taken at different times after a patient drinks a white, chalky fluid called barium, that shows up clearly on x-rays.  The test allows the doctor to examine the lining of the intestine for any irregularities.  The test is good for large abnormalities, but can miss many smaller ones. However, it is safe and easy to tolerate.</p>

<p>A second x-ray test, the enteroclysis study, is similar to the small bowel follow-through in that it uses barium to visualize the inner wall of the small bowel.  It is more invasive because it requires a small tube called a catheter to be slowly advanced from the nose down the esophagus, through the stomach and into the small bowel, to allow for air and barium to be instilled.  The advantage of this study is that pictures from enteroclysis have better resolution, so abnormalities missed by the small bowel follow-through test may be detected.  A disadvantage of the enteroclysis study is that it can be an uncomfortable examination due to the presence of the catheter and the use of air to distend the small bowel while taking pictures.  In some cases a CT scan is used instead of regular x-rays.  This allows for even more detail to be seen.</p>

<p>A third test is known as a CT enterography.  A CT enterography is performed the same way a normal CT scan is done.  The patient drinks an oral contrast solution (often dilute barium) while also receiving intravenous (IV) contrast.  Then numerous, very detailed images are obtained.  A CT enterography differs from a standard CT scan in that the type of contrast that the patient drinks is designed to allow for a more detailed inspection of the lining of the small bowel.</p>

<p>While none of these tests is perfect at finding abnormalities, the advantage of these tests is that they can sometimes find bleeding sources that are out of reach of a standard enteroscope.  The major limitations of these studies are that they cannot detect AVMs, and if an abnormality is seen, there is no way to apply immediate treatment to stop the bleeding, to take biopsies to confirm a diagnosis, or to mark the location of the lesion with a tattoo.  In addition, some patients are allergic to the IV contrast that is used as part of the CT scan.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/capsule-endoscopy/" class="faqquestion">What is capsule endoscopy?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>In 2000, a group of doctors from England reported the use of a new instrument for determining the causes of small bowel bleeding.  The device, the capsule endoscope, is 1-1/8 inches long and 3/8 inches wide (26 mm x 11 mm), the size of a large pill.  It is composed of a battery with an 8-hour lifespan, a strong light source, a camera, and a small transmitter.  Once swallowed, the capsule begins transmitting images of the inside of the esophagus, stomach and small bowel to a receiver worn by the patient.  The capsule takes two pictures per second, for a total of approximately 55,000 images.  After 8 hours, the patient returns the receiver to the doctor who downloads the information to a computer and then can review in detail the 8 hours of pictures of the capsule passing through the intestine, looking for abnormalities that are possible sources of bleeding.  The patient passes the capsule through the colon and it is eliminated in the stool and discarded.  The capsule is generally safe and easy to take, however, the capsule can get stuck in the small intestine if there has been prior abdominal surgery causing scarring or other conditions that cause narrowing of the small intestine.  If the capsule becomes stuck, endoscopic or surgical removal is necessary.  In about 15% of exams, the capsule does not view the entire small bowel prior to the battery running out and may need to be repeated.</p>

<p>Like x-rays, the capsule is purely diagnostic and cannot be used to take biopsies, apply therapy, or mark abnormalities for surgery.  Moreover, the capsule cannot be controlled once it has been ingested, so that once it has passed a suspicious abnormality, its progress cannot be slowed to better visualize the area.  Despite these limitations, capsule endoscopy is frequently the test of choice for finding a source of small bowel bleeding if standard endoscopy has failed to do so.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/capsule-endoscopy/" class="faqquestion">How effective is capsule endoscopy at detecting the source of small bowel bleeding?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>In an initial study, investigators showed that the capsule was better than routine endoscopy or enteroscopy at locating small beads that had been implanted into an animal's intestine.  Other studies have shown the capsule is more effective than small bowel x-rays at finding the cause of bleeding.  In 2001, the first human studies reported that capsule endoscopy not only found all of the bleeding sources seen using standard endoscopy, but also an additional bleeding cause in 56% of patients for whom traditional endoscopy had not been successful.  Overall, in cases of what is known as occult bleeding (blood is microscopically present in the stool, but the stool looks normal), capsule endoscopy finds a potential source of bleeding in up to 67% of patients.  In cases of overt bleeding (blood is seen in the stool or the stool is black and tarry as a result of digested blood), the results are highly variable.  If the bleed happened in the past, the yield may be as low as 6%.  If, however, the doctor believes that there is active bleeding occurring at the time of the test, the yield is &gt;90%.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/capsule-endoscopy/" class="faqquestion">What is deep small bowel enteroscopy?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>In cases where a lesion has been found deep in the small bowel, beyond the reach of standard endoscopy, evaluation of the deep small bowel may be required.  One option to further evaluate or to treat the lesion is known as double-balloon enteroscopy.  In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new type of endoscope known as a double-balloon enteroscope (the name derives from the fact that the scope uses two balloons to aid with the examination).   This scope is capable of reaching very far into the small bowel (in some cases as far as the ileum, which is the final segment of the small bowel).  This scope can also be inserted through the anus, which allows for examination of the deepest parts of the small bowel (the scope must first pass through the colon).  In some cases, by performing the examination through the mouth and through the anus, it is possible to examine the entire length of the small bowel, though this is not always possible.  Because an examination using a double-balloon enteroscope is much more involved than standard endoscopy (it often takes hours to perform as opposed to 20 minutes for standard endoscopy), it is usually reserved for cases in which a source of small bowel bleeding out of reach of a standard enteroscope had been found on either an x-ray or capsule endoscopy.  In one study, double-balloon enteroscopy was able to locate a bleeding source in 74% of patients.  When a source is found, other studies have reported successful treatment in 63 to 71% (in these studies, treatment was considered successful if the patient did not require further blood transfusions).</p>

<p>In addition to double-balloon enteroscopy, two other options for evaluating the small bowel have been introduced.  One is single-balloon enteroscopy, which is a procedure similar to double-balloon enteroscopy, though in this case there is only one balloon attached to the scope to aid with the examination.  A second option is deep small bowel enteroscopy using a special spiral tube that fits over the scope and allows the endoscope to be advanced into the deep small bowel.  This device works differently than balloon assisted enteroscopy and may offer the advantage of being a shorter procedure.  Currently, it is only used for lesions that are likely to be reachable by inserting the scope through the mouth.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/capsule-endoscopy/" class="faqquestion">What is intraoperative enteroscopy?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>In some cases, surgical assistance may be needed. Intraoperative enteroscopy is carried out in the operating room under general anesthesia. The surgeon, often working with a gastroenterologist (a doctor who specializes in the GI tract), inserts the endoscope through the patientâs mouth or through a small incision in the small bowel (an enterotomy). The surgeon then advances the endoscope through the intestine, allowing for full examination of the entire small bowel. The advantage of intraoperative enteroscopy is that it allows the doctor to treat the cause of bleeding at the time of discovery (for AVMs), or to remove masses or polyps that are found. Because it is an invasive, surgical procedure, however, intraoperative enteroscopy is usually reserved for cases where other methods have failed to find or treat the source of bleeding. Overall, it is effective in treating the source of bleeding in approximately 70% of the patients who require the procedure.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/capsule-endoscopy/" class="faqquestion">How is small bowel bleeding treated?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>In cases of AVMs, a small amount of electric current can be delivered through the endoscope to cauterize the abnormality. If the AVM is discovered during endoscopy, the treatment can be applied immediately without requiring further endoscopy. If the bleeding source is found by capsule endoscopy, treatment options include endoscopy, standard enteroscopy, double-balloon enteroscopy or intraoperative enteroscopy (depending on the location of the lesion and prior attempts at treating it; see above). In rare cases where numerous AVMs are present within a segment of small bowel, the segment of small bowel may need to be removed surgically. Polyps can be removed with an endoscope or at the time of surgery in cases where the polyp cannot be removed with an endoscope. Tumors, both benign and malignant, typically require surgical removal (while benign tumors do not necessarily need to be removed in all cases, if they are causing significant blood loss removal is usually recommended). Other causes of small bowel bleeding can be treated medically (e.g., Crohn's disease or medication induced ulcers).</p>
<h3>12. Conclusions</h3>
<p>Bleeding from the small bowel is a rare, often difficult to diagnose cause of GI blood loss. AVMs account for 30 to 40% of cases, and are the primary source of bleeding in patients over the age of 50. Tumors (benign and malignant), polyps, Crohnâs disease, and ulcers are some of the other sources of bleeding. Multiple techniques are used to diagnose and treat the source of small bowel bleeding, including: endoscopy, enteroscopy, x-ray studies, capsule endoscopy, deep small bowel enteroscopy, and intraoperative enteroscopy. AVMs can typically be treated with cautery delivered through an endoscope or enteroscope. Tumors (benign and malignant) can be biopsied and have their location marked using endoscopy, but surgery is typically required for their removal. Other conditions, such as Crohnâs disease, are often treated with medications.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colonoscopy/" class="faqquestion">
What is colonoscopy?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Colonoscopy is a procedure which enables a physician (usually a gastroenterologist) to directly image and examine the entire colon. It is effective in the diagnosis and/or evaluation of various GI disorders (e.g. colon polyps, colon cancer, diverticulosis, inflammatory bowel disease, bleeding, change in bowel habits, abdominal pain, obstruction and abnormal x-rays or CT scans) as well as in providing therapy (for example, removal of polyps or control of bleeding). It is also used for screening for colon cancer. A key advantage of this technique is that it allows both imaging of abnormal findings and also therapy or removal of these lesions during the same examination. This procedure is particularly helpful for identification and removal of precancerous polyps.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colonoscopy/" class="faqquestion">What is a colonoscope?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>A colonoscope is a flexible and steerable instrument to evaluate the entire colon (large intestine). The large intestine is approximately 3 â 4 feet long. A colonoscope is engineered such that biopsies of suspicious areas can be obtained, and polyps (which may turn into cancer) can be removed.</p>
<h3>Has colonoscopy been shown to be effective in preventing cancer of the colon and saving lives</h3>
<p>Yes. Colonoscopy accomplishes this by detecting and removing polyps, and detecting early cancers. Recent data show that both the number of new cases of colon cancer (incidence) and deaths from the disease are decreased when colonoscopy is performed according to established guidelines (see Question 11).</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colonoscopy/" class="faqquestion">If colonoscopy is so effective at detecting polyps, colon cancer and saving lives, why arenât more people having it?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The most common reason patients cite for not getting a colonoscopy is that their doctor did not discuss it with them. The next most common reason is fear or avoidance of the preparation (âprepâ), which involves taking a laxative which causes temporary diarrhea for several hours. In addition, many people are simply unaware that they need colon cancer screening.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colonoscopy/" class="faqquestion">Is colonoscopy painful? Will I be sedated?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>No, colonoscopy is usually not painful! Almost all colonoscopies can be performed using âintravenous sedationâ or âtwilight sedationâ in which you are very drowsy, but comfortable and still breathing on your own. The most common type of sedation also has a mild amnesiac effect, so most patients do not even remember the procedure! Your doctor can discuss with you the best form of sedation to suit your needs.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colonoscopy/" class="faqquestion">Will my insurance pay for this procedure?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Medicare (and most third party payers) will pay for colonoscopy for colon cancer screening, thanks to the hard work of advocacy groups and the efforts of national organizations such as the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG). Regrettably, a recent study showed a low compliance rate for screening (less than 30%) among Medicare patients.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colonoscopy/" class="faqquestion">What is my risk of developing colon cancer if I live in the United States?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Your lifetime risk (defined as life to 85 years old) is approximately 6% (male or female). Your risk is roughly doubled if one (1) first degree relative (parent, sibling or child) had colon cancer or polyps after age 50, and is higher if the cancer or polyps were diagnosed at a younger age or if more members of your family are affected. Certain inherited disorders, for example, polyposis syndromes and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, can increase your risk of developing colon cancer, but those are rare. Other important risk factors include obesity, cigarette smoking, inflammatory conditions in the colon such as Crohnâs, colitis and ulcerative colitis, and excessive alcohol consumption. Your doctor is in the best position to discuss whether your personal or family history suggests one of those conditions.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colonoscopy/" class="faqquestion">When should I have a colonoscopy?</strong></a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>If you have no colorectal symptoms, family history of colon cancer, polyps or inflammatory bowel disease you should have your first exam at age 50 whether you are a man or a woman since colon cancer affects both EQUALLY! Recent evidence suggests that African Americans should begin screening earlier at the age of 45.</p>

<p>If one or more first degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had a precancerous polyp or colon cancer, the general guideline is to begin colon cancer screening 10 years younger than the youngest age of the family member with colon cancer, or age 40, whichever is younger. There are additional guidelines for suspected or confirmed rare syndromes, and you should discuss these options with your doctor.</p>

<p>For patients with ulcerative colitis involving the entire colon and patients with Crohnâs disease, screening for colon cancer should begin 8 â 10 years after the initial diagnosis is made.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colonoscopy/" class="faqquestion">Are there other methods to examine my colon besides colonoscopy?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Yes, there are alternative methods to examine the colon, but none are considered more accurate at colon cancer and polyp detection than colonoscopy. They include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A flexible sigmoidoscopy and a barium enema (an x-ray examination of the colon after it has been distended by barium, a contrast agent, following a preparation with a FleetÂ® Enema or FleetÂ® Phospho-soda).</li>
	<li>Computerized tomography (CT), a test that takes pictures of the inside of the colon, can also be done. This is called CT colography or âvirtual colonoscopyâ. Like conventional colonoscopy, this test requires a full preparation the day before the exam (liquids and possibly enemas). This test, however, involves radiation exposure which may increase your long term risk of development of cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the above tests suggest the presence of polyps or cancer, a conventional colonoscopy (and a second preparation) will be required.</p>

<p>Fecal Occult Blood Testing (FOBT), is a test whereby stool is examined for minute amounts of blood loss (possibly from polyps or cancer) by way of a chemical reaction resulting in a color change. While FOBT is not a test to examine the colon, it is recommended annually to individuals over age 50. If occult blood is found in the stool, a follow up colonoscopy will be necessary.</p>

<p>For colon cancer screening, it should be noted that colonoscopy has the highest sensitivity and is the only test that is both diagnostic and therapeutic.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colonoscopy/" class="faqquestion">What is the âprepâ for colonoscopy like? How many different preps are out there?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>This is an important obstacle in the eyes of many patients to getting a colonoscopy, but it need not be!</a>

There are a variety of preparation methods for colonoscopy ranging from liquids (of varying quantity) with or without enemas, to pills, which rid your colon of feces. A clean colon is essential to allow for a careful examination for polyps or other abnormalities. Your doctor can discuss and prescribe the most appropriate preparation method for you, taking into account various factors such as your age, personal preferences, kidney function and physical stamina.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The most popular preparation used for colonoscopy involves drinking a volume of solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG). This solution causes a diarrhea that effectively rids the colon of its contents. Various fruit flavors are available and patients have several hours to drink it. Usually a patient will have clear liquids the day of the preparation (day before the colonoscopy) and then take half of the prep in the late afternoon or that evening. The other half is done approximately 5 hours before coming in for the test the following day. Patients are encouraged to drink a lot of fluids and to continue clear liquids up until 2 hours before their scheduled procedure. Before going to bed, many doctors also prescribe a laxative pill (e.g. DulcolaxÂ®) that helps with the evacuation process.</li>
	<li>Smaller volumes of solution (e.g. MoviPrepÂ®, HalfLytelyÂ®) or pill preparations (e.g. OsmoPrepÂ®) have also recently become available with similarly good outcomes to PEG for people who dread the thought of large volumes of liquid.</li>
	<li>Another preparation involves a phosphate solution (called FleetÂ® Phospho-soda) which consists of two (2) rounds of phosphate rich liquid of 45ml each the night before and day of the exam. It is essential to drink at least 2 quarts of water with these preps to replace losses.</li>
	<li>Alternatively, a phosphate tablet preparation of about 30 pills is available and is also very effective for colon cleansing and is preferred by some patients. This preparation also requires that you drink at least 2 quarts of water to replace losses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phospho-sodaÂ® prep should be avoided in patients with significant heart or kidney problems, in elderly patients who have difficulty maintaining hydration and with caution in patients with significant liver problems.</p>

<p>The best method of colonic preparation should be discussed with the gastroenterologist so that a method that suits the patientâs preference may be selected.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colonoscopy/" class="faqquestion">Are there any complications from colonoscopy?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Yes, but potential complications are associated with virtually every form of testing done in medicine. Clearly, colonoscopy has been found to be extremely safe when performed by a well trained physician such as a gastroenterologist. Although quite rare, most complications are related to sedation administration (cardiac and respiratory problems); the colon may also become partially torn (perforated) and this may require surgery. Rarely, bleeding from polyp removal or from the procedure itself may require additional treatment such as hospitalization and/or blood transfusions. As one reads about these procedures, the reader should weigh these low risks against the far more frequent complication of developing colon cancer if appropriate testing is NOT done.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver  disease (NAFLD) is a very common disorder and refers to a group of conditions  where there is accumulation of excess fat in the liver of people who drink  little or no alcohol. The most common form of NAFLD is a non serious condition  called fatty liver. In fatty liver, fat accumulates in the liver cells.  Although having fat in the liver is not normal, by itself it probably does not  damage the liver. A small group of people with NAFLD may have a more serious  condition named non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In NASH, fat accumulation  is associated with liver cell inflammation and different degrees of scarring.  NASH is a potentially serious condition that may lead to severe liver scarring  and cirrhosis. Cirrhosis occurs when the liver sustains substantial damage, and  the liver cells are gradually replaced by scar tissue (see figure), which  results in the inability of the liver to work properly. Some patients who  develop cirrhosis may eventually require a liver transplant (surgery to remove  the damaged liver and replace it with a ânewâ liver). </p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>NAFLD is part of the metabolic syndrome  characterized by diabetes, or pre-diabetes (insulin resistance), being  overweight or obese, elevated blood lipids such as cholesterol and  triglycerides, as well as high blood pressure. Not all patients have all the  manifestations of the metabolic syndrome. Less is known about what causes NASH  to develop. Researchers are focusing on several factors that may contribute to  the development of NASH. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Oxidative stress (imbalance between pro-oxidant and anti-oxidant  chemicals that lead to liver cell damage)</li>
  <li>Production and release of toxic inflammatory proteins (cytokines) by  the patientâs own inflammatory cells, liver cells, or fat cells</li>
  <li>Liver cell necrosis or death, called apoptosis<u></u></li>
  <li>Adipose tissue (fat tissue) inflammation and infiltration by white  blood cells<u></u></li>
  <li>Gut microbiota (intestinal bacteria) which may play a role in liver  inflammation<u></u></li>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>NAFLD is a very common disorder  affecting and may affect as many as one in three to one in five adults and around  one in ten children in the United States. Obesity is thought to be the most  common cause of fatty infiltration of the liver. Some experts estimate that  about two thirds of obese adults and half of obese children may have fatty  liver. About 2 to 5 percent of adult Americans and up to 20 percent of those  who are obese may suffer from the more severe condition NASH. The number of  children who have NASH is not known. The presence of type 2 diabetes and other  conditions associated with insulin resistance, such as polycystic ovarian  syndrome are know risk factors for the development of fatty liver and NASH.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The  diagnosis of NAFLD is usually first suspected in an overweight or obese person  who is found to have mild elevations in their liver tests during a routine  blood testing or incidentally detected on radiologic investigations such as  abdominal ultrasound or CT scan. Some experts are now recommending that every  obese child or adolescent should have these liver enzymes checked. However  NAFLD can be present with normal liver blood tests. The diagnosis of NAFLD is  confirmed by imaging studies, most commonly a liver ultrasound, showing  accumulation of fat in the liver. Fat accumulation in the liver can also be  caused by excess alcohol intake, certain medications, viral hepatitis,  autoimmune liver disease, and metabolic or inherited liver disease. These need  to be excluded as causes of fatty liver disease in order to confirm the  diagnosis of NAFLD. Currently, the only reliable way of telling whether a  person has NASH or simple fatty liver is by a liver biopsy. In this procedure,  a small needle is inserted through the skin after local anesthesia is given to  obtain a small piece of the liver for microscopic evaluation. NASH is diagnosed  when examination of this piece of liver under the microscope shows fatty  infiltration of the liver in addition to inflammation and different degrees of  scarring. If only fat is present, then the diagnosis of simple fatty liver is  made. The liver biopsy provides essential information regarding the degree of  scarring within the liver, which would not be apparent on a blood test,  ultrasound, or an x-ray alone. Liver biopsy rarely can be associated with  serious risks including bleeding and patients should discuss the risks and  benefits of the procedure with their physician.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>A few studies  have suggested that weight loss may be associated with regression of fat within  the liver. Therefore, the most important recommendations for people with fatty  liver are to lose weight if they are overweight or obese, increase their  physical activity, follow a balanced diet and avoid alcohol and unnecessary  medications. New evidence suggests that Mediterranean diet (rich in  monounsaturated fatty acids) may be more beneficial than low fat diet. Drinking  coffee seems to decrease the risk of having fatty liver in large cohort  studies. In patients with NASH, the more severe form of NAFLD, these same  recommendations may be helpful. It is also important to control diabetes and  treat elevated cholesterol levels when appropriate. Development of medications  that could treat NAFD and NASH is an area of intense research. Recent trials in  adult and children have shown that vitamin E (an anti-oxidant) could help  improve NASH in non-diabetic patients. Strategies currently being evaluated by  physicians and scientists to decrease the amount of fat/ inflammation in the  liver include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weight reduction (diet + exercise, medications,  surgery)</li>
  <li>Lipid lowering medications </li>
  <li>Insulin sensitizers (medications)</li>
  <li>Decrease the amount of liver inflammation by  administering anti-oxidant medications, anti-apoptotic medications and  anti-cytokine medications</li>
</ul>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[						<h3>What is Colorectal Cancer?</h3>
						<p>Colorectal (large bowel) cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the inner lining of the colon or rectum. Together, the colon and rectum make up the large bowel or large intestine. The large intestine is the last segment of the digestive system (the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine are the first three sections). The large bowel's main job is to reabsorb water from the contents of the intestine so that solid waste can be expelled into the toilet. The first several feet of the large intestine is the colon and the last 6 inches is the rectum.  </p>
						<p>Most colon and rectal cancers originate from benign wart-like growths on the inner lining of the colon or rectum called polyps. Not all polyps have the potential to transform into cancer. Those that do have the potential are called adenomas. It takes more than 10 years in most cases for an adenoma to develop into cancer. This is why some colon cancer prevention tests are effective even if done at 10-year intervals. This 10-year interval is too long, in some cases, such as in persons with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis, and in persons with a strong family history of colorectal cancer or adenomas.</p>
						<h3>How Common is Colorectal Cancer?</h3>
						<p>Colorectal cancer is the number 2 cancer killer in the United States, yet it is one of the most preventable types of cancer and often curable when detected early. </p>
						<p>In the United States, colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men, after skin, prostate, and lung cancer. It is also the fourth most common cancer in women, after skin, breast, and lung cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute.</p>
						<p><strong>Estimated new cases and deaths</strong> from colon and rectal cancer in the United States in 2010:<br />
							New cases: 102,900 (colon); 39,670 (rectal)<br />
							Deaths: 51,370 (colon and rectal combined)</p>
						<p><strong>Source: National Cancer Institute</strong></p>
						<p><strong>Colonoscopy:</strong> Preferred Screening Strategy</p>
						<p>Colonoscopy is the preferred method of screening for colorectal cancer. The American College of Gastroenterology considers colonoscopy the âgold standardâ for colorectal screening because colonoscopy allows physicians to look directly at the entire colon and to identify suspicious growths. Colonoscopy is the only test that allows a biopsy or removal of a polyp at the very same time it is first identified.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[						<h3>What are the symptoms of colorectal cancer?</h3>
						<p>Most early colorectal cancers produce no symptoms. This is why screening for colorectal cancer is so important. Symptoms of colorectal cancer vary depending on the location of the cancer within the colon or rectum, though there may be no symptoms at all. The prognosis tends to be worse in symptomatic as compared to asymptomatic individuals.</p> 
						<p>The most common presenting symptom of colorectal cancer is rectal bleeding. Cancers arising from the left side of the colon generally cause bleeding, or in their late stages may cause constipation, abdominal pain, and obstructive symptoms.</p> 
						<p>On the other hand, right-sided colon lesions may produce vague abdominal aching, but are unlikely to present with obstruction or altered bowel habit. Other symptoms such as weakness, weight loss, or anemia resulting from chronic blood loss may accompany cancer of the right side of the colon. You should promptly see your doctor when you experience any of these symptoms.</p>
						<p>Remember to promptly see your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>New onset of abdominal pain</li>
							<li>Blood in or on the stool</li>
							<li>A change in stool caliber or shape</li>
							<li>A change in typical bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea </li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Why should you get checked for colorectal cancer even if you have no symptoms?</h3>
						<p>Adenomas can grow for years and transform into cancer without producing any symptoms. By the time symptoms develop, it is often too late to cure the cancer, because it may have spread. Screening identifies cancers earlier and actually results in cancer prevention when it leads to removal of adenomas (pre-cancerous polyps).</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/aspirin-and-nsaids/" class="faqquestion">What should I know about Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS)?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The second major cause for ulcers is irritation of the stomach arising from regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. NSAIDs are available over-the-counter (OTC) and by prescription.</p>

<p>If you are taking over-the-counter pain medications on a regular basis, you will want to talk with your physician about the potential for ulcers and other GI side effects. NSAID-induced gastrointestinal side effects can be reduced by using alternative therapy. Your doctor may recommend that you change the medication you are using; or add some other medication in conjunction with your pain medication.</p>
</div>

<a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/aspirin-and-nsaids/" class="faqquestion">Things to Remember about NSAIDs</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>GI bleeding is an important, and potentially serious condition. It can arise initially with few if any symptoms. Ulcers can be promoted by the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. While some damage may occur with modest, short-term doses, problems are more likely to arise in regular NSAID users, and increase with the magnitude of use--more frequent use and/or higher dosages.</p>

<p>NSAIDs and aspirin have some very positive health benefits. Like all medications, care must be taken with their use. For example, they should not be taken with alcohol, as the combination can increase the risk of GI bleeding. Patients who need to use NSAIDs regularly should consult regularly with their physician to be alert for any potential GI effects. Since problems may arise with few, if any, symptoms, ongoing monitoring with your physician is important. If problems do arise, and are recognized early, there are a variety of ways to minimize or reverse any adverse effects, either by using alternatives to NSAIDs, or through your physician prescribing medications that can reduce any adverse effects.</p><br>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>If you are taking over-the-counter NSAIDs on a regular basis, you will want to talk with your physician about the potential for ulcers and other GI side effects. Most patients contact their family doctor, or primary care physician, when they experience GI problems. Many of these disorders, including Helicobacter pylori infection, can be treated readily by your primary care doctor.</p>

<p>In the case of recurring or more serious problems, you may need to see a gastroenterologist, a physician who specializes in disorders and conditions of the gastrointestinal tract.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/aspirin-and-nsaids/" class="faqquestion">NSAIDS â Issues that May Arise with Regular Use of NSAIDS</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>At one time aspirin was virtually the only non-prescription pain reliever available. It has always had excellent pain relief benefits, but it was also recognized that, when used regularly, it could cause digestive problems for some patients. Some modified versions of aspirin came onto the market in an effort to achieve the benefits of aspirin while "buffering" the prospect for stomach discomfort. Acetaminophen achieves similar benefits of pain relief, with minimal, if any, impact on the stomach lining.</p>

<p>New NSAID medications became available in prescription form that also offered excellent pain relief, but like aspirin, these new prescription medications also had the potential to promote the development of ulcers and bleeding in the GI tract. Since they were being administered under a doctor's prescription, any such effects could be monitored.</p>

<p>NSAIDs became more popular as prescription remedies, and the FDA has approved several for sale to consumers without a prescription. A partial list of NSAIDs that are available over-the-counter and recommended maximum daily doses is below.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/aspirin-and-nsaids/" class="faqquestion">Balancing Pain Relief and Concerns with Side Effects</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Adverse side effects can accompany the benefits in a portion of patients taking any medication. No drugs escape the need for this kind of risk-benefit evaluation. It has become necessary to balance the benefits of analgesia, platelet inhibition, and anti-inflammatory effect from NSAIDs and aspirin against potential adverse effects on the stomach and digestive system. For patients who are dependent on regular use of pain relievers, this can mean determining whether there are alternate ways to achieve pain relief, without risking ulcers or GI bleeding which may accompany regular use of aspirin and NSAIDs.</p>

<p>In this regard, aspirin and NSAIDs have been found to cause damage to the lining (or mucosa) of the digestive tract primarily in the stomach and upper intestine. This damage can result in an ulcer or intestinal bleeding. Although this can happen to an individual who is an infrequent user of aspirin or NSAIDs, it is of a much greater concern in frequent users, and those consuming higher dosages of these medications.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/aspirin-and-nsaids/" class="faqquestion">Personal Medical History is Important</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>As with any other risk-benefit analysis, the determination of the risk associated with a particular patient's use of NSAIDs requires a careful look at the patient's medical history. Here are some key issues:</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Age</span>: Has been identified as a risk factor in several studies. Older patients also often require pain medications more often or in larger doses, further increasing their risk.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Previous Ulcer</span>: A history of an ulcer or an ulcer complication have been identified in several studies as risk factors for complications due to aspirin or NSAIDs use.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Alcohol</span>: Alcohol, taken alone can cause irritation of the GI tract. There have been some indications that patients who consume alcohol at the same time they are taking aspirin or NSAIDs have an increased risk of damage to the intestinal lining, including ulcers and GI bleeding. There have been some reports that chronic heavy alcohol users may be at increased risk of liver toxicity from excessive acetaminophen use. Individuals who consume large amounts of alcohol should not exceed recommended doses of acetaminophen. In 1993, FDA Advisory Committees recommended that all OTC pain relievers contain an alcohol warning--to date, some, but not all OTC pain relief products have complied with that recommendation. Chronic heavy alcohol users should consult their physician for advice on when and how to take pain relievers.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Steroids</span>: Patients taking NSAIDs who also are taking a prescription corticosteroid, medications like prednisone (in doses over 10 mg), have been found to have a seven fold increased risk of having GI bleeding.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Anti-coagulants</span>: Similarly, patients who are taking NSAIDs at the same time they are taking oral prescription anti-coagulants (for example, medications like coumadin) have been found to have a 12-fold increased risk of bleeding.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/aspirin-and-nsaids/" class="faqquestion">Magnitude of NSAID Use</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Adverse effects associated with NSAIDs become more likely as the cumulative amount of NSAID increases, relating both to the size of each dose you take, as well as how frequentlyâhow many times a day, how many days a weekâyou consume NSAIDs.</p>

<p>The most important ground rule, however, is to follow the instructions on your medication. No medicationâwhether a prescription or over-the-counter drugâshould be taken more frequently than is directed in the labeling.</p>

<p>Most NSAID ulcers heal easily if the NSAIDs are stopped. If the medication cannot be stopped, the dose may often be reduced. Even if your physician determines that continued administration of NSAIDS is needed, healing can still occur.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>An individual can develop damage to the intestinal lining without being aware of itâsignificant GI bleeding occurs frequently without any symptoms being present.</p>

<p>Of particular concern are patients with arthritic conditions. More than 14 million such patients consume NSAIDs regularly. Up to 60% will have gastrointestinal side effects related to these drugs and more than 10% will cease recommended medications because of troublesome gastrointestinal symptoms.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Conventional treatments for ulcers (classes of prescription ulcer drugs called H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors), have been found to have a beneficial effect in treating NSAID-induced ulcers and in preventing GI bleeding. These treatments often will be effective, particularly if NSAID use is stopped or reduced, although healing can occur in many cases where a patient receives these anti-ulcer medications, even when NSAID use continues.</p>

<p>Another medication, misoprostol, has been used effectively to prevent gastric and duodenal ulcers and has been shown to reduce the risk of bleeding in those that must continue using NSAIDs. As with all instances where patients are taking more than one prescription or over-the-counter medication, patients and their physicians need to evaluate any side effects, potential drug interactions, or other factors, for example limitations on use during pregnancy.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The main benefit recognized early on for aspirin was the relief of pain and the reduction in fever. Other important health benefits from aspirin have also come to be recognized. One of the more important of these is the use of aspirin in helping to prevent heart attack and perhaps stoke. The benefit stems from aspirinâs role as a platelet inhibitor. Studies have shown that these benefits can be obtained with a relatively small daily dose of aspirin.</p>

<p>NSAIDS were found to have an additional benefit of reducing inflammation, and so helped alleviate not only the symptom of pain, but also served to reduce the actual cause of the pain, for example, reducing joint inflammation in arthritis.</p>

If diarrhea lasts more than two weeks, we call it chronic diarrhea. It is important to notice if the diarrhea stools are bloody, oily (fatty) or watery, which can help your doctor arrive at the most likely cause of your symptoms.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<h3>What causes chronic bloody diarrhea?</h3>
<p>Chronic bloody diarrhea is most likely due to Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). These include ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Pain with defecation suggests rectal inflammation. Tell your doctor if you have a family history of IBD, have unintentional weight loss, fever, abdominal cramping or decreased appetite, which might suggest a diagnosis of IBD.</p>

<p>Other less common causes include ischemia of the gut, infections, radiation therapy and colon cancer or polyps.</p>

<h3><strong>What causes chronic oily or fatty diarrhea?</strong></h3>
<p>Maldigestion or malabsorption syndromes are the cause of fatty stools. Tell your doctor if you experience bulky, greasy or very bad smelling stools. Chronic pancreatitis is a cause of pancreatic insufficiency, which leads to maldigestion and fatty stools. Alcohol abuse is a common cause of chronic pancreatitis in the United States. Other causes of chronic pancreatitis include cystic fibrosis, hereditary pancreatitis, trauma to the pancreas and pancreatic cancer.</p>

<p>Biliary tract obstruction, cholestatic liver disease, and bacterial overgrowth can also lead to maldigestion problems. Gluten sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease, celiac sprue) is the most common small bowel disease causing fat malabsorption. Additional common causes of malabsorption in the United States are other small bowel mucosal diseases or surgical resection of the small bowel. Whippleâs disease, tropical sprue and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are very uncommon conditions that can lead to malabsorption.</p>

<h3><strong>What causes chronic watery diarrhea?</strong></h3>
<p>There are may causes of watery diarrhea, including carbohydrate malabsorption such as lactose, sorbitol, and fructose intolerance, intestinal infections or Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Certain medications such as NSAIDs, antacids, antihypertensives, antibiotics and antiarrhythmics can cause diarrhea in some people.</p>

<p>Symptoms of abdominal bloating and excessive gas after consuming dairy products suggest lactose intolerance. This condition is more common in African-Americans and Asian-Americans. Certain soft drinks, juices, dried fruits and gums contain sorbitol and fructose, which can lead to watery diarrhea in people with sorbitol and fructose intolerance.</p>

<p>Intestinal infections such as giardiasis, opportunistic infections in someone with HIV (cryptosporidiosis, microsporidiosis, etc.) can cause chronic watery diarrhea. Diabetes mellitus may be associated with diarrhea due to nerve damage and bacterial overgrowth; this occurs mainly in patient's with long-standing, poorly-controlled diabetes.</p>

<p>Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), is a condition often associated with frequent stools, alteration in bowel habits, and abdominal pain. These symptoms are key features of this syndrome, though many with IBS have constipation rather than diarrhea. Emotional or physiologic distress can worsen IBS symptoms. IBS is recognized as a motility disorder where no anatomic or organic diseases are found to account for the symptoms.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<h3>Basic Tests for Evaluation of Chronic Diarrhea</h3>
<p>Your doctor will want to further assess etiologic factors or complications of diarrhea by obtaining several tests. These include: a blood count to look for anemia and infections, an electrolyte and kidney function panel to assess for electrolyte abnormalities and renal insufficiency, and albumin to assess your nutritional status.</p>

<p>A stool sample may help define the type of diarrhea. The presence of fat, occult blood, and white blood cells will help determine if a watery, inflammatory, or fatty diarrhea is present. A bacterial culture and ova/parasite studies of a stool specimen will also help determine if an infectious etiology is present.</p>


<h3>What Radiographic and Endoscopic testing is available for evaluation of chronic diarrhea?</h3>
<p>Radiographic studies are not routinely performed in the evaluation of chronic diarrhea, as findings seen in radiographic studies are fairly non-specific, but occasionally can be helpful. These can include an upper GI series or barium enema. Ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen can be helpful to evaluate the pancreas or other intra-abdominal organs.</p>

<p>Endoscopic examination of the colon with flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy is more specific than radiographic studies in detecting the etiology of chronic diarrhea, as this allows direct examination of the bowel mucosa and the ability to obtain biopsies for microscopic evaluation as is endoscopy for evaluation of the upper GI tract. Double-balloon enteroscopy and capsule endoscopy are sometimes used to examine the mucosa of the small intestine that lies beyond the reach of conventional endoscopies.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<h3>What is the treatment of chronic diarrhea?</h3>
<p>This depends on the etiology of the chronic diarrhea. Often, empiric treatment can be provided for symptomatic relief, when a specific diagnosis is not reached, or when a diagnosis that is not specifically treatable is reached. Whether to empirically treat with antibiotics for treatment of enteric pathogens prior to initiation of an extensive workup is the decision of the health care provider.</p>

<p>Antimotility agents and opiate antidiarrheal drugs are the most effective agents for the treatment of chronic diarrhea. They reduce symptoms as well as stool weight. Finally, in an effort to avoid becoming dehydrated from a chronic diarrhea process, oral hydration should be encouraged.</p>

  <p>Gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD is a condition in  which stomach contents enter into the esophagus (called reflux) The most common  reflux symptom are heartburn or regurgitation. Reflux may lead to damage  to the lining of the esophagus. The usual cause of GERD is a weak or  incompetent valve muscle at the bottom of the esophagus (lower esophageal  sphincter) that normally prevents stomach contents from entering the esophagus.  GERD can lead to complications including ulcers in the lining of the esophagus,  bleeding, narrowing of the esophagus that can cause difficulty swallowing (a  stricture) and a condition called Barrettâs esophagus, which has a risk of  turning into cancer of the esophagus.

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<h3>What are the common treatments for gastroesophageal  reflux disease?</h3>
<p>The most common treatments for GERD are making lifestyle  changes and avoiding foods that can cause reflux. Lifestyle changes  include weight loss, stopping cigarette smoking and diet changes (avoiding the  foods that cause symptoms of GERD such as acidic drinks, tomato sauce, spicy  foods, peppermint, and chocolate as well as avoiding eating for 2 to 3 hours  before lying down). High fat foods can lead to reflux symptoms by slowing down  stomach emptying. A number of medications can worsen reflux, such as  theophylline. There are several prescription medications available to  treat GERD. These medications can control symptoms in most people. Many  of the acid reducing drugs are now available over the counter. There is a  surgical procedure that can control symptoms in the appropriate patient. Please see the web page entitledâ¦</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<h3>What are the endoscopic treatments for gastroesophageal reflux disease?</h3>
  <p>There is now technology available that allows physicians to  perform various procedures that can treat the symptoms of GERD with an  endoscope. An endoscope is an instrument with a lighted camera attached to the  end of a flexible tube. It can be passed through the mouth into the esophagus  and stomach to evaluate the inside structure of the digestive tract. These  therapies are not considered to be surgery in the usual sense, as there is no  cutting on the outside of the body; all the changes are made on the inside the  body using the endoscope. Entry is made through an existing opening (the mouth).  It is an outpatient procedure meaning patients will be able to go home the same  day, though they may feel tired from the sedating medications and driving is  prohibited the day of the procedure.</p>
    <p>There are currently 2 types of endoscopic treatments for GERD:  1) Heat energy (Stretta) and 2) Sewing or suturing (EndoCinch and the  Plicator). The Food and Drug Administration have approved these for clinical  use. In addition, a number of other treatments are now being studied or under  development that may become available in the near future. </p>  
<h3>How do the endoscopic treatments of gastroesophageal  reflux disease work?</h3>
<p>In general, it is believed that the valve muscle at the  bottom of the esophagus is strengthened by endoscopic GERD treatments. Changes  in the valve muscle region can reduce the number of episodes of stomach  contents refluxing into the esophagus.</p>
<h3>Who should be considered for an endoscopic treatment of  gastroesophageal reflux disease?</h3>
  <p>There are no clear recommendations for which patients are  best suited for an endoscopic treatment of GERD. Experience with surgery for  GERD shows that patients with the typical GERD symptoms of heartburn and  regurgitation and who respond to medications have the best results. Most  studies on the endoscopic treatments for GERD have been performed in  these types of patients. Patients who do not wish to take  medications long term, and do not want to undergo surgery, should talk to their  doctor about the possibility of endoscopic treatment. Patients with Barrettâs  esophagus, the very overweight, those with hiatal hernias greater than 2  centimeters in size, symptoms other than heartburn and regurgitation (chest  pain, hoarseness, cough), or those with symptoms that do not respond completely  to medications are not good candidates for endoscopic treatment as they have  not been well studies.</p>
  <p>Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a very common disorder, and medical therapy  is very safe. Concerns about endoscopic treatment modalities are the limited  safety data and unclear long-term effectiveness in relieving symptoms.  Endoscopic treatments can result in serious complications, including death.  Therefore, it is unclear at this time, who is the ideal candidate for these  procedures. Many gastroenterologists have chosen not to perform these  procedures so they are limited in availability.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<h3>What are the diagnostic tests done before the endoscopic  anti-reflux procedure?</h3>
  <p>Patients should go through a complete evaluation for GERD  with several tests prior to the endoscopic treatment procedure. This  evaluation is similar to patients who are being considered for traditional  surgery for GERD. The exact evaluation will depend on your symptoms and the  judgment of your physicians to determine which of the tests described below may  be needed. The tests that are commonly done are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Upper endoscopy</strong>: a procedure in which a flexible tube with a lighted camera attached to the end is passed       through the mouth into your stomach to look at the inside of the       esophagus, stomach and part of the small bowel. </li>
  <li><strong>Ambulatory pH study</strong> (an acid test of your esophagus a test to measure acid exposure in the esophagus): this       test is available with two types of pH sensors</li>
  <ul>
    <li>A small plastic tube is passed into the end of  your esophagus through your nose and the acid in the esophagus is measured for  a day (24 hours).</li>
    <li>A small capsule (BRAVO capsule) is attached to  the lining of the esophagus, typically during your endoscopy; the capsule  transmits acid recordings of the esophagus to a beeper-like device that you  wear for 2 days (48 hours). The recording device is then returned for analysis.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Esophageal       manometry</strong>: a procedure where       the movement and the pressure of the esophagus is measured. This is       done by passing a small plastic tube into the end of your esophagus       through your nose. </li>
  <li><strong>Barium swallow</strong>: an x-ray study of       the esophagus in which barium is swallowed and x-ray pictures of the       esophagus are taken to evaluate the esophagus.</li>
  <li><strong>Gastric emptying</strong> scan: a study       where solid food or a liquid sprayed with radioactive materials (that can       be picked up by a special radiation counter) is swallowed and the emptying       of the stomach is recorded.</li>
</ul>
<p>These tests are designed to help your physician to evaluate  your esophagus and stomach to see if you would be a suitable candidate for the  endoscopic GERD treatment. Alternatively, other treatment approaches may be  better for you (such as continued medical therapy or surgery) and can be  discussed with your physician.</p>

			<wp:meta_key><![CDATA[_acg_gi_patients_cpt_basics_sectioncontent_5]]></wp:meta_key>
			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<h3>What are the success rates for the endoscopic therapies  for gastroesophageal reflux disease?</h3>
  <p>Endoscopic treatment of GERD has been available for just a  few years. Initial response rates for the endoscopic treatments appear to  be very good. Symptom improvement and reduction or elimination of medication  use has been seen in the range of 60% to 80% 6 months to a year after the  procedure. The studies to date suggest that after 2-year the response  rates (off medications without symptoms) of the currently available treatment  options are reduced and many will require restarting medication.. For  anti-reflux surgery, the 2-year success rate is 80% to 90%. Long-term follow up  information for endoscopic treatments for GERD is not yet available so patients  should not expect the procedure to last indefinitely. This  procedure often reduces the amount of acid reflux into the esophagus, but does  not completely restore it to the normal level.</p>
  <h3>How safe and tolerable are endoscopic therapies for  gastroesophageal reflux disease?</h3>
  <p>The safety profiles of all approved endoscopic treatments  have been in general good. However, there have been some serious  complications that have been reported. For the heat energy device  (Stretta), the side effects reported include fever, chest pain, bleeding,  pneumonia and a few deaths. For the endoscopic suturing treatment (EndoCinch  and the Plicator), the reported complications are bleeding, pneumonia, and a  tear in the lining of the stomach or esophagus (perforation). These tears may  require surgery to repair them.</p>
  <h3>What do these procedures involve? What happens during the  procedure?</h3>
  <p>During the procedure, patients are sedated and their  physicians decide on the type of sedation used. This can range from conscious  sedation (patients feel drowsy but remain awake and not anesthetized) to  general anesthesia. The endoscope is then passed into the stomach and for all  procedures; the device will be then passed to the valve region. For the  Stretta procedure, the Stretta catheter will be passed down to the flap valve  area, the balloon is then inflated and the heat energy is passed through the  area. For the endoscopic suturing procedure, the suturing device will be  attached to the end of the endoscope and sutures will be placed at the flap  valve area.</p>
  <h3>What should I expect the day of the procedure?</h3>
  <p>Immediately after the procedure, patients may experience  symptoms related to the procedure such as sore throat, drowsiness, nausea, and  vomiting that may be related to the sedation. If the procedure goes well you  will be discharged the same day. However, if you develop any of the following  symptoms you should contact your physician immediately; fever, chills, vomiting  of blood, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any passage of a black bowel  movement or bright red blood in the stool. In addition if you have significant light-headedness  or if you faint/black-out, you need to see a physician immediately. These  symptoms may be related to complications of bleeding, infection or perforation  of the esophagus.</p>
  <h3>What should I expect after the endoscopic  gastroesophageal reflux disease treatment procedure?</h3>
  <p>The majority of patients report improvement of their  heartburn symptoms within the first month. Some patients report improvement of  their heartburn symptoms gradually over the next few months. Since other  symptoms of GERD have not been well studied no comment can be made on whether  or not they will improve. There are no standard recommendations for medications  or diets after the treatment procedure. Each centers will have individual  recommendations for their patients. Please consult your physician for  instructions on diet and medication use following the endoscopy treatment.</p>
  <h3>Am I a candidate for an endoscopic gastroesophageal  reflux disease treatment procedure and if I am a candidate, which treatment  should I have?</h3>
  <p>Medical therapy is the most common treatment for patients  with GERD, and is successful in most patients. Medical therapy is very well  tolerated long term with few complications. As such a minority of  patients will need to consider alternatives. Endoscopic therapy for GERD is  performed only in selected centers, so please check with your physician to see  if you are a candidate for an endoscopic GERD treatment procedure. If  after discussion of the pros and cons of the available procedures you wish to  proceed you should be aware that there is not one endoscopic GERD treatment  procedure that has shown to be significantly better than other endoscopic  treatment and that these treatments have not been compared to medical or  surgical therapy. The best procedure for you will depend on  your history, symptoms and results of your diagnostic tests.</p>

 <p>The hepatitis C virus is the most common cause of   chronic viral liver disease in the United States.  It is   estimated that 1.8% of the U.S. population or about   4 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C.   Infection is most prevalent among those born between   1945â1965, the majority of whom were likely infected   during the 1970s and 1980s when rates were highest. The CDC estimates that there are 30,000 new   acute cases of hepatitis C each year.</p>
<h3>How many patients with hepatitis C develop cirrhosis?</h3>
 <p>It is estimated that nearly 20% of patients with   chronic hepatitis C will develop cirrhosis over a period   of decades. Factors which influence progression to   cirrhosis include co-infection with hepatitis B or the   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), alcohol use   and obesity.</p>
<h3>Who gets hepatitis C infection?</h3>
<p>Hepatitis C is spread primarily by contact with blood   and blood products. The use of injection illicit drugs   is the most common mode of disease transmission   including those people who injected illicit drugs only   one time many years ago. People who received blood   transfusions, transfusion of blood products or organ   donations prior to 1992, when sensitive tests for HCV   were introduced for blood screening, are at risk for   hepatitis C infection, as are persons who received   clotting factors prior to 1987.  Other persons at risk for hepatitis C include long-term   kidney dialysis patients, people with tattoos and body   piercing other than pierced ears, health care workers   after exposures (i.e., needle stick or splashes to the   eye) from the blood of an infected person while on the   job, infants born to HCV-infected mothers, people with   high-risk sexual behavior, multiple partners and sexually transmitted diseases, people who snort cocaine   using shared equipment, and people who have shared   toothbrushes, razors and other personal items with a   family member who is HCV-infected.</p>
<h3>What precautions can I take in order to avoid   transmitting HCV?</h3>
 <p>People who have hepatitis C should remain aware   that their blood is potentially infectious. People with   hepatitis C should avoid the use of intravenous drugs.   Household items such as razors or toothbrushes   should not be shared. The hepatitis C virus can be   infectious for up to 16 hours outside the body. If you   are a health care or public safety worker, always follow   routine barrier precautions and safely handle needles   and other sharps; get vaccinated against hepatitis B.   Consider the risks if you are thinking about getting a   tattoo or body piercing. You might infect others if you   share the needles or piercing equipment.</p>
<h3>Is hepatitis C sexually transmitted?</h3>
 <p>HCV can be spread by sex, but this is rare, accounting   for less than 1% of overall cases. Sexual transmission   is more common in men having sex with men.  If you   are having sex with more than one steady sex partner,   use latex condoms correctly and every time to prevent   the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<h3>What are the signs and symptoms of hepatitis C?</h3>
 <p>Approximately 20%â30% of those newly infected   with HCV experience fatigue, abdominal pain, poor   appetite, or jaundice. In those persons who do   develop symptoms, the average time period from   exposure to symptom onset is 4â12 weeks   (range: 2â24 weeks).   The majority of people with chronic hepatitis C have   no symptoms of liver disease. People with chronic   hepatitis C may complain of abdominal pain, fatigue,   itching or nausea. Once the patient develops cirrhosis,   signs and symptoms may be more prominent. These   symptoms might include jaundice, muscle weakness,   nausea, weight loss, abdominal swelling, vomiting   blood, blood in stool, and confusion.</p>
<h3>Can hepatitis C affect other organs?</h3>
 <p>A small percentage of persons with chronic HCV infection develop medical conditions due to hepatitis C   that are not limited to the liver. These conditions are   thought to be attributable to the body's immune response to HCV infection. Such conditions can include   diabetes mellitus, which occurs three times more frequently in HCV-infected persons; glomerulonephritis, a   type of kidney disease caused by inflammation of the
  kidney; essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, a condition involving the presence of abnormal proteins in   the blood; porphyria cutanea tarda, an abnormality in
  heme production that causes skin fragility and blistering and; non-Hodgkins lymphoma, which might occur   somewhat more frequently in HCV-infected persons.</p>
<h3>What are the initial tests used to detect hepatitis C   infection?</h3>
 <p>Several blood tests are performed to test for HCV   infection. Screening tests include hepatitis C antibody   (anti-HCV) by enzyme immunoassay (EIA)  and recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA).</p>
<h3>How soon after exposure can the virus be detected?</h3>
 <p>HCV infection can be detected by anti-HCV screening   tests (enzyme immunoassay) 4â10 weeks after infection. Anti-HCV can be detected in &gt;97% of persons by   6 months after exposure.</p>
<h3>How is the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C confirmed?</h3>
 <p>Following a positive hepatitis C antibody test, the   presence of hepatitis C infection is confirmed by   hepatitis C viral load testing. Qualitative or quantitative viral load testing (HCV-RNA by PCR) may be used   to detect the presence of hepatitis C in the blood.</p>
<h3>How soon after exposure can the virus be detected?</h3>
 <p>The virus appears in blood and can be detected as   early as 2â3 weeks after infection.</p>
<h3>Under what circumstances is a false-positive antiHCV test result likely?</h3>
 <p>False-positive anti-HCV tests appear more often when   persons at low risk for HCV infection (e.g., blood   donors) are tested. Therefore, it is important to   confirm a positive anti-HCV test with a supplemental   test, such as RIBA (recombinant immunoblot assay),   as most false positive anti-HCV tests are reported as   negative on supplemental testing.</p>
<h3>Under what circumstance is a false-negative   anti-HCV test result likely?</h3>
 <p>Persons with early HCV infection might not yet have   developed antibody levels high enough that the test   can measure. In addition, some persons might lack   the immune response necessary for the test to work   well. In these persons, further testing to detect the   presence of the virus in blood may be considered.</p>
<h3>What is the significance of the level of virus in the   serum (viral load)?</h3>
 <p>Hepatitis C viral load does not correlate with disease   progression or with degree of inflammation or fibrosis   seen on liver biopsy. Patients with high viral loads are   less likely to respond to currently approved antiviral   treatment regimens.</p>
<h3>What is the significance of genotype testing?</h3>
 <p>There are six known genotypes and more than 90   subtypes of hepatitis C. Knowing the genotype can help   predict the likelihood of treatment response and, in   many cases, determine the duration of treatment. The   most common genotype seen in the United States is   genotype 1. Genotype is not associated with disease   progression but is associated with varying response   to current antiviral therapies. Patients with genotype 2   or 3 have higher sustained viral response rates to pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy than those with   genotypes 1 or 4. There is little published information   on the treatment of genotypes 5 or 6. Once the genotype is identified, it need not be tested again; genotypes do not change during the course of infection.</p>
<h3>Can infection with more than one genotype of   HCV occur?</h3>
 <p>Infection is possible if risk behaviors for HCV infection   continue, but it is believed to be very uncommon.</p>
<h3>What do the liver enzymes indicate?</h3>
 <p>The liver enzymes (ALT and AST) may be elevated in   chronic hepatitis C infection. ALT in HCV is not correlated with disease progression or underlying histology.   Many patients with chronic hepatitis C have normal   ALT levels. It is common for patients with chronic   Hepatitis C to have liver enzyme levels that go up and   down, with periodic returns to normal or near normal   levels. Liver enzyme levels can remain normal for over   a year despite chronic liver disease.</p>
<h3>Why do I need to have a liver biopsy?</h3>
 <p>A liver biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis.  Liver   biopsy is helpful for grading the severity of inflammation, staging the amount of fibrosis and determining   the presence of cirrhosis and determining the degree   of fatty infiltration of the liver. Liver biopsy is the best   test to determine how damaged the liver is.</p>
<h3>What are my treatment options at this time?</h3>
 <p>Combination therapy with pegylated interferon and   ribavirin is the treatment of choice, resulting in sustained virologic response (defined as undetectable   virus in the patient's blood 24 weeks after the end of   treatment) rates of 40%â80% (up to 50% for patients   infected with genotype 1, the most common genotype   found in the United States, and up to 80% for patients   infected with genotypes 2 or 3). Combination therapy   using interferon and ribavirin is FDA-approved for use   in children ages 3â17 years. A sustained virologic   response is the best definition of cure that we have   for hepatitis C.</p>
<h3>What is the duration of treatment?</h3>
 <p>At the current time, the duration of treatment for   patients with genotype 1 or 4 is 48 weeks and  24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 or 3.</p>
<h3>Who should be treated?</h3>
 <p>Treatment is currently recommended for patients with   detectable hepatitis C virus in the blood that have at   least moderate inflammation and/or have any fibrosis   (scar tissue) found on liver biopsy and who do not have   any contraindications to therapy.  Patients with milder   changes on liver biopsy, or who have not had a liver   biopsy, should be managed on an individual basis.</p>
<h3>Who should not be treated with interferon?</h3>
 <p>Patients with advanced liver disease with symptoms   such as fluid retention, confusion or history of recent   gastrointestinal bleeding should not be treated with   interferon. In addition, patients who have severe   uncontrolled depression or other significant psychiatric   illnesses, patients with autoimmune disease that are   not well-controlled, and patients who are actively using   illicit substances should not be treated with interferon.</p>
<h3>What are the options for patients who do not   respond to treatment?</h3>
 <p>At this point, re-treatment of pegylated interferon and   ribavirin treatment failures with a similar drug regimen   yields disappointing response rates. Newer, experimental therapies are being evaluated for use in this   group of patients.</p>
<h3>What are the side effects of interferon therapy?</h3>
 <p>Many patients will develop flu-like symptoms in the   early stages of therapy. Other common side effects  include fatigue, muscle aches, nausea and vomiting,   skin irritation at the injection site, rash, headaches,   mood changes, i.e. depression, anxiety, mania, and   suicidal ideation, and changes in blood cell counts   such as low white cell count and low platelet counts.</p>
<h3>What are the common side effects of ribavirin therapy?</h3>
 <p>Common side effects secondary to ribavirin include   nausea, insomnia, hemolytic anemia, fatigue, and   cough.  Ribavirin may cause birth defects and/or   fetal death when used during pregnancy. Women of   childbearing potential and their male partners must   use two forms of reliable birth control (contraception)   during treatment and for 6 months after ribavirin has   been stopped to avoid pregnancy.</p>
<h3>What happens if I develop any of these side effects?</h3>
 <p>Patients are monitored very closely during treatment.   The side effects are assessed and medications may   be prescribed to handle those side effects.</p>
<h3>What about liver transplantation?</h3>
 <p>Hepatitis C is a common indication for liver transplantation in the United States. Liver transplantation   involves removing the diseased liver from the patients   and replacing it with a healthy liver from either a live   or cadaveric donor. Liver transplantation is indicated   for those patients with hepatitis C who have   cirrhosis with life-threatening complications.</p>
<h3>What are the chances of developing a life-threatening   complication related to chronic hepatitis C?</h3>
 <p>Life threatening complications of hepatitis C are rare   unless cirrhosis has developed. Once cirrhosis is   present, the chance of developing a life-threatening   complication over a period of 5 to 10 years is 50%.</p>
<h3>Can patients with hepatitis C drink alcohol?</h3>
 <p>Regular alcohol intake has been shown to lead   to increased liver damage in patients who have   hepatitis C. HCV-positive persons should be a  dvised to avoid alcohol because it can accelerate   liver damage and progression to complications   from cirrhosis. 30.  Should HCV-infected persons be restricted from   working in certain occupations or settings?</p>
  The CDC's current recommendations for prevention   and control of HCV infection specify that persons   should not be excluded from work, school, play, child   care, or other settings on the basis of their HCV infection status. There is no evidence of HCV transmission   from food handlers, teachers, or other service providers in the absence of blood-to-blood contact.</p>
<h3>What is the risk for HCV infection from a needlestick   exposure to HCV-contaminated blood?</h3>
 <p>After a needlestick or sharps exposure to HCV-positive   blood, the risk of HCV infection is approximately 1.8%   (range: 0%â10%).</p>
<h3>Other than needlesticks, do other exposures, such   as splashes to the eye, pose a risk to healthcare   personnel for HCV transmission?</h3>
 <p>Although a few cases of HCV transmission via blood   splash to the eye have been reported, the risk for   such transmission is expected to be very low. Avoiding occupational exposure to blood is the primary   way to prevent transmission of bloodborne illnesses   among healthcare personnel. All healthcare personnel should adhere to Standard Precautions.  Depending on the medical procedure involved, Standard   Precautions may include the appropriate use of   personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, masks,   and protective eyewear).</p>
<h3>Should HCV-infected healthcare personnel be   restricted in their work?</h3>
 <p>There are no CDC recommendations to restrict a   healthcare worker who is infected with HCV. The risk   of transmission from an infected healthcare worker   to a patient appears to be very low. All healthcare   personnel, including those who are HCV positive,   should follow strict aseptic technique and Standard   Precautions, including appropriate hand hygiene, use   of protective barriers, and safe injection practices.</p>
<h3>Should pregnant women be routinely tested   for hepatitis C?</h3>
 <p>No. Since pregnant women have no greater risk of   being infected with HCV than non-pregnant women   and interventions to prevent mother-to-child   transmission are lacking, routine testing of pregnant   women for hepatitis C is not recommended. Pregnant   women should be tested for hepatitis C only if they   have risk factors for HCV infection.</p>
<h3>What is the risk that an HCV-infected mother will   spread HCV to her infant during birth?</h3>
 <p>Approximately 4 of every 100 infants born to HCV  infected mothers become infected with the virus.   Transmission can occur at the time of birth, and no   procedures are available to reduce this risk. The risk   is increased by the presence of high levels of hepatitis C virus in the mother at delivery and also is   2â3 times greater if the woman is co-infected with HIV.   Most infants infected with HCV at birth have no symptoms and do well during childhood. More research is   needed to find out the long-term effects of perinatal   HCV infection.</p>
<h3>Should a woman with HCV infection be advised   against breastfeeding?</h3>
 <p>No. There is no evidence that breastfeeding spreads   HCV. However, HCV-positive mothers should consider   abstaining from breastfeeding if their nipples are   cracked or bleeding.</p>
<h3>When should children born to HCV-infected mothers   be tested to see if they were infected at birth?</h3>
 <p>Children should be tested for hepatitis C no sooner   than age 18 months because hepatitis C antibodies   from the mother might last until this age. If diagnosis   is desired before the child turns 18 months, testing for HCV RNA could be performed at or after the   infant's first well-child visit at age 1â2 months. HCV   RNA testing should then be repeated at a subsequent   visit, independent of the initial HCV RNA test result.</p>
<h3>Is there a vaccine for hepatitis C?</h3>
 <p>At present time, a hepatitis C vaccine is not available.</p>

<h3>What is gastroesophageal reflux?</h3>
<p>Gastroesophageal reflux is the bringing up of stomach contents or acid into the esophagus (the swallowing tube). Almost everyone refluxes at some point during the day especially after meals. What distinguishes normal reflux from pathologic or abnormal reflux is how often reflux occurs and if it causes symptoms or damage to the esophagus. Reflux is being increasingly recognized in children and adolescents. Although the symptoms in teenagers may be similar to those seen in adults, the symptoms in infants and younger children may differ enough so that they are not recognized as being due to reflux.</p>
<h3>Is it normal if my infant spits up?</h3>
<p>Almost all infants reflux or regurgitate a portion of their feeding at one time or another. What distinguishes normal regurgitation from abnormal regurgitation is how often the reflux occurs, if it is associated with discomfort, and if it results in other complications. These complications include poor weight gain known as âfailure to thriveâ, breathing difficulties such as infrequent breaths or apnea, asthma symptoms such as wheezing, or a hoarse voice or cry. Other complications of reflux are aspiration, which is when the refluxed stomach contents reach the lungs, pneumonia due to aspiration, or inflammation of the esophagus called esophagitis. Spitting up blood or material that looks like old âcoffee groundsâ is rarely seen and requires evaluation by a physician.</p>
<p>Reflux symptoms in infants tend to get better as they get older, usually by 12 to 15 months. This is because as infants get older their stomach is able to empty quicker and their esophagus lengthens, therefore there is less material in the stomach to regurgitate. Infants who reflux or regurgitate will not necessarily have problems with reflux as they get older or as adults.</p>
<h3>Is vomiting in my baby always due to gastroesophageal reflux?</h3>
<p>There are a number of reasons, other than reflux, that a baby may vomit. Babies may be allergic to the milk or soy protein that they are getting in their formula and this can result in irritability, vomiting, poor weight gain and blood in the bowel movements. This is treated with a change to a specialized formula where the proteins are broken down to make them less allergenic (allergy causing). Babies can be born with problems where the intestine is not formed or positioned properly or is blocked. These types of problems are usually found in the immediate newborn period but can present later in some infants. A combination of x-rays and or endoscopy (looking at the lining of the stomach and upper intestines and/or colon with a long tube with a video camera at the tip) is usually helpful to make this diagnosis.</p>
<p>Between 4-8 weeks of age infants can develop a condition known as pyloric stenosis. This results in significant and forceful vomiting and is usually associated with poor weight gain and possibly weight loss. Parents of infants with this problem describe their child's vomiting as projectile. Pyloric stenosis is currently treated with surgery. There are other non-gastrointestinal causes of vomiting in infants and young children including hormonal problems, kidney problems and problems with increased pressure on the brain. These are unusual conditions but patients should be tested for these problems if their physician feels that their symptoms are not typical or they are not responding to medications.</p>
<h3>What are the symptoms of reflux in older children and adolescents?</h3>
<p>Reflux symptoms in children are variable. Children may be unable to communicate typical heartburn symptoms. They may complain of generalized stomachaches, frequently around the area of the belly button and on occasion may complain of chest pain. Often children will report a feeling that they need to throw up and on occasion will describe that they get a taste in their mouth as if they have thrown up. Other children will report that they feel that the food is coming back up and that they then re-swallow it. Occasionally they will report a feeling that food is not going down correctly or feels like it is getting stuck. Some patients may complain of asthma symptoms such as cough or wheezing that are worsened by reflux. Even though children may not relate reflux symptoms to eating, obtaining a dietary history for foods and medicines that trigger reflux is important.</p>
<h3>How is the diagnosis of reflux made?</h3>
<p>Reflux is usually diagnosed based on symptoms and physical examination. X-rays are generally not helpful in diagnosing abnormal reflux although they are often used to exclude other problems that may mimic reflux. Performing an upper intestinal endoscopy with biopsies can be helpful to determine if inflammation of the esophagus is present. The test currently considered most helpful in making the diagnosis of acid reflux is a pH probe. This probe is a small tube inserted through the nose into the esophagus that continuously measures how often acid is being regurgitated into the esophagus. There are normal expected values for children and adults.</p>
<h3>What are treatment choices for children and adolescents with gastroesophageal reflux?</h3>
<p>There are many medications available to treat gastroesophageal reflux. Many of these medications have been used successfully to treat children. Dosages of medication must be modified for a child's weight. Also they require monitoring to reduce possible long-term side effects. Diet is an important part of reflux management and children and teenagers with reflux should avoid the products listed below. Medications such as aspirin, ibuprofen and alcohol based products should be avoided if possible in children with reflux. Rarely a surgical procedure called a fundoplication (or wrap) is required for severe reflux. This procedure is usually reserved for patients with severe symptoms or complications of reflux that do not respond to standard medications and dietary treatment.</p>
<p><em>Foods to avoid if you have reflux</em></p>
<p>Spicy, acidic or tomato based foods<br>
  Fatty foods<br>
  Citrus products including citrus juices<br>
  Apple juice (apples are fine)<br>
  Caffeinated drinks- cola, tea, coffee, hot chocolate<br>
  Chocolate and licorice</p>

<h2>LACTOSE INTOLERANCE</h2>
<h3>What is Lactose Intolerance?</h3>
<p>Lactose is the sugar found in milk and dairy products such as cheese and yogurt. After eating dairy products that contain this sugar, lactase a digestive enzyme of the small intestine, helps to breakdown this complex sugar into two simple sugars. Normally lactase breaks down lactose into two components, glucose and galactose. These simple sugars are then absorbed in the small intestine and ultimately reach the blood stream where they act as nutrients. The enzyme lactase is located in the lining of the small intestine known as the intestinal villi.</p>
<p>Lactose is also the sugar found in breast milk and standard infant formulas. Therefore almost all babies are able to digest and absorb this sugar and it serves as their primary dietary sugar.</p>
<h3>What are other sources of lactose?</h3>
<p>In addition to milk and dairy products such as ice cream, yogurt and cheese, lactose can be found in bread and baked goods, processed breakfast cereals, instant potatoes, some soups and non-kosher lunch meats, candies, dressings and mixes for pancakes and biscuits.</p>
<h3>Who gets lactose intolerance?</h3>
<p>Rarely babies may be born with a deficiency or absence of the enzyme lactase. This condition is very rare and is known as primary lactase deficiency. Babies inherit this condition by getting one gene that causes this problem from each of their parents, even though both parents may be lactose tolerant. Babies who lack this enzyme may have severe feeding problems with diarrhea, vomiting and poor growth starting in early infancy. These babies require a specialized formula with another type of sugar such as sucrose (present in table sugar), which they are able to digest. The majority of infants who have feeding problems however are not lactose intolerant.</p>
<p>A cause of temporary lactose intolerance in infants and young children is infection. Older infants and young children will commonly be infected by a virus known as rotavirus. Most children will have had at least one episode of this type of infection by the age of five years, with the majority of cases occurring before two years of age. The symptoms of rotavirus infection include vomiting, diarrhea (frequent watery stools), and fever. This type of viral infection commonly causes damage to the lining of the small intestine. Because this is where the enzyme lactase is located, rotavirus infection often results in lactose intolerance. This type of lactose intolerance is transient or temporary, however, and when the lining of the intestine returns to normal within three to four weeks, the lactose intolerance usually goes away. Another type of infection that causes temporary lactose intolerance is giardia infection. Giardia is a parasite that is found in well water and fresh water from lakes and streams and also causes damage to the surface of the small intestine resulting in temporary lactose intolerance. Treatment of the giardia with antibiotics will resolve the lactose intolerance.</p>
<p>Many individuals acquire lactose intolerance as they get older. It is estimated that approximately one half of adults in the United States have acquired lactase deficiency. This condition is due to a normal decline in the amount of the enzyme lactase present in the small intestine as we age. Although lactose is an important part of the diet in infants and young children it represents only 10% of the carbohydrate (sugar) intake in adults. However, individuals who are lactose intolerant may not be able to tolerate even small amounts of this sugar in their diet.</p>
<p>Lactose intolerance occurs more frequently in certain families. One of the most important factors affecting the rate of developing lactose intolerance is an individual's ethnic background. Approximately 15% of adult Caucasians, and 85% of adult African Americans in the United States are lactose intolerant. The rate of lactose intolerance is also very high in individuals of Asian descent, Hispanic descent, Native Americans and Jewish individuals.</p>
<h3>What are the symptoms of lactose intolerance?</h3>
<p>The symptoms of lactose intolerance can start during childhood or adolescence and tend to get worse with age. The severity of symptoms is usually proportional to the amount of the milk sugar ingested with more symptoms following a meal with higher milk sugar content. The symptoms of lactose intolerance are abdominal distension and pain, excess burping, loud bowel sounds, excess gas and diarrhea following ingestion of lactose. An individual who is lactose intolerant may have very watery and explosive bowel movements. Individuals who are lactose intolerant may feel a sense of urgency with bowel movements. This means that they feel that they have to get to the bathroom immediately or they will have an accident. If someone who is lactose intolerant does not eat lactose they will not have the symptoms noted above.</p>
<p>Although eating lactose containing products will result in discomfort for someone who is lactose intolerant, they will not be harmed by eating lactose. There are no long term concerns for someone who is lactose intolerant of developing more serious intestinal disease because of this. The only exception to this would be for babies who are born with primary lactase deficiency or children with secondary lactase deficiency as discussed above. These children may have poor growth as a result of chronic diarrhea and malnutrition if they are not switched to a lactose free diet or supplemented with the lactase enzyme (commercially available).</p>
<h3>What causes the symptoms of lactose intolerance?</h3>
<p>Because lactose is not digested properly in the small intestine in individuals who are lactose intolerant, it passes whole into the large intestine or colon. Upon reaching the colon it is broken down by the normal colon bacteria. This breakdown results in the production of carbon dioxide and hydrogen gases and short chain fatty acids. The carbon dioxide and short chain fatty acids produced in the colon result in the symptoms of lactose intolerance. The hydrogen is absorbed and ultimately excreted in the breath as described below.</p>
<h3>How is lactose intolerance diagnosed?</h3>
<p>Lactose intolerance is diagnosed by a simple test called a breath hydrogen test. After a period of fasting from midnight the night before the test, an individual drinks a specified amount of the milk sugar as a syrup. In adults this corresponds to the amount of milk sugar in a quart of milk. They then breathe into a test bag every fifteen minutes for approximately two hours. The breath that they exhale into the bag is analyzed to determine its hydrogen content. During the course of the test individuals who are lactose intolerant will have an increase in the amount of hydrogen that they exhale. If the values for hydrogen increase above a certain value the diagnosis of lactose intolerance is made. Patients who are lactose intolerant may also develop their typical symptoms during the test.</p>
<h3>What can be done to treat or manage lactose intolerance?</h3>
<p>The best treatment of the symptoms of lactose intolerance is a combination of dietary modification and taking a supplement to aid in digestion of lactose. Individuals who are lactose intolerant should meet with a dietician to review the sources of lactose in their diet. Some reduction in the daily lactose consumption is usually required. When an individual is going to be eating a food that contains lactose they should take a commercially available non prescription lactase supplement at the time of lactose ingestion. This type of supplement can be taken throughout the day whenever lactose is ingested. Some individuals will be less lactose intolerant and therefore will be able to tolerate comparatively larger amounts of lactose. Alternatives to milk for lactose intolerant individuals include products such as soy milk. If an individual is restricting their milk/ dairy intake it is important to ensure adequate supplementation of calcium in the diet. This is especially important for pediatric patients and women.</p>

<h3>Is it possible to become temporarily lactose intolerant?</h3>
<p>There are several conditions in older children, adolescents and adults that can cause temporary lactose intolerance. The lactose intolerance usually resolves with treatment. These diseases include acute diarrhea due to an infection, celiac sprue which is an intolerance to wheat products, Crohnâs disease of the small intestine discussed below, and other causes of malnutrition.</p>

<h2>INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE</h2>
<h3>What is inflammatory bowel disease?</h3>
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease refers to a chronic (long term/ lifelong) inflammation or irritation of the stomach, small intestine and/or colon (large bowel). Inflammatory bowel disease should not be confused with irritable bowel syndrome which is discussed elsewhere in the web book. There are two types or categories of inflammatory bowel disease, Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's disease. Patients can have either type but not both. Occasionally one type of inflammatory bowel disease is diagnosed and with further testing or time the disease may be re-diagnosed as the other type.</p>
<h3>What is the difference between Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease?</h3>
<p>Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease differ primarily in the portions of the bowel that they each involve and also the layers of the bowel wall that are involved. Ulcerative colitis involves only the large bowel. It can involve a part of the large bowel only or the entire large bowel but it does not have âskipâ areas. Skip areas are areas of the intestine that are normal with abnormal areas on either side of them. Ulcerative colitis only involves the innermost layer of the bowel (the lining of the bowel) known as the mucosa. It does not involve deeper layers of the bowel. Crohnâs disease on the other hand can involve any area of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the rectum (the last portion of the colon) and the anus. Crohnâs disease involves not only the lining of the bowel, but can and usually does involve the deeper layers of the bowel. Even though Crohnâs disease can involve any portion of the gastrointestinal tract it typically does not involve every portion of the gastrointestinal tract. The most common sites of involvement are the end of the small intestine known as the terminal ileum, involved in up to 80% of patients, involvement in the colon in approximately 50% of patients, with approximately 5% of patients having disease in their stomach or first part of the small intestine known as the duodenum.</p>
<h3>How common is ulcerative colitis and Crohnâs disease in pediatric patients?</h3>
<p>Both ulcerative colitis and Crohnâs disease are relatively uncommon problems in both children and adults. The incidence or number of new cases occurring each year appears to be increasing more for Crohnâs disease than for ulcerative colitis. In a group of approximately 100,000 children age 15 years or younger, it is estimated that approximately 2 or 3 of them will develop Crohnâs disease each year. However in a group of 100,000 children age 15-19, the rate of developing Crohnâs disease increases to 16 new cases per year. The chance of developing ulcerative colitis in childhood and adolescence is less than the chance of developing Crohnâs disease, with an incidence of 2 to 10 new cases per 100,000 population per year. The teenage years are one of the most likely times for inflammatory bowel disease to be diagnosed. The other most common time is between 30-40 years of age.</p>
<p>Both ulcerative colitis and Crohnâs disease are more common in certain families. In large studies it has been shown that if someone has either ulcerative colitis or Crohnâs and all of their close family members (parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and children) are followed for a period of thirty years there is a one in three chance of another family member developing either ulcerative colitis or Crohnâs disease. If the original family member has ulcerative colitis the relative is likely to develop ulcerative colitis and if they have Crohns disease the relative is likely to develop Crohns. Neither ulcerative colitis nor Crohnâs disease are contagious, which means that you cannot catch it from your family member. The reason for family members being more likely to develop these diseases is probably due to inheriting a gene that makes an individual more susceptible to develop this type of inflammation of the bowel. In addition to being more common in certain families, both ulcerative colitis and Crohnâs disease are more common in certain ethnic groups, especially Jewish individuals of eastern European descent.</p>
<h3>What are the symptoms of Ulcerative Colitis in children and teenagers?</h3>
<p>The most common symptoms of ulcerative colitis in children and teenagers are diarrhea, blood in the bowel movements and pain in the abdomen. Patients with this condition may have pain prior to a bowel movement that improves after a bowel movement, and frequent bowel movements up to 10 times per day or more. Patients may also feel that they need to have a bowel movement immediately or they are going to have an accident. Having bowel movements at night is not uncommon in patients with ulcerative colitis, especially when the colon is more inflamed. Other symptoms in children can include anemia (a low blood count), weight loss and poor growth, although the later two are more common with longstanding disease and more likely to occur with Crohnâs disease.</p>
<h3>What are the symptoms of Crohnâs disease in children and teenagers?</h3>
<p>The symptoms of Crohnâs disease may be subtler than those of ulcerative colitis or may be dramatic. Abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss are the most common symptoms occurring in 65-75% of patients. Poor growth is also common and a very important sign of pediatric Crohnâs disease. A child who is usually amongst the tallest in their class who becomes amongst the smallest, especially around the time of puberty may have Crohnâs disease. The average time between the first symptoms of Crohnâs disease and the diagnosis of Crohnâs disease may be up to a year in some studies, due to the subtle first symptoms of Crohns disease. Fatigue or being tired due to anemia is common as is blood in the bowel movements, although less common than in ulcerative colitis. Up to 25% of patients will have disease around their bottom or anus; this may go unrecognized in a teenager who is uncomfortable discussing bowel issues with their parents or doctors. This includes extra folds of skin, which may become inflamed and can be painful, drainage of pus from small openings in the skin known as fistulas and fissures or cracks in the skin around the anus that may be painful.</p>
<h3>How is the diagnosis made of ulcerative colitis or Crohnâs disease?</h3>
<p>After a careful history and physical examination your doctor can order blood work to screen for ulcerative colitis or Crohnâs disease. Blood work that would be abnormal in these conditions can include a blood count demonstrating anemia, especially if the iron level is low, an increased white blood cell count which may indicate inflammation or infection, an increased platelet count (the part of the blood that is responsible for helping blood clot), decreased blood levels of proteins such as albumin and an elevated sedimentation rate, a nonspecific marker of inflammation. There are new additional blood tests available that detect certain antibodies found more commonly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. However testing positive or negative for these antibodies does not establish or rule out the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease and therefore expert interpretation of these blood tests is required.</p>
<p>An x-ray called an upper GI with small bowel follow through can be obtained to look for irregularity in the small intestine. This is particularly helpful in pediatric patients, as the terminal ileum, which is the end of the small intestine, is the site most commonly abnormal in children with Crohnâs disease.</p>
<p>Endoscopy with biopsy (taking samples of tissue) also known as performing a scope test is the definitive way to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease and also to determine how much of the colon is involved. Endoscopy can also be performed of the stomach and first part of the small intestine in patients suspected of having Crohnâs disease. Medications are given during the procedure to sedate the patient and increase the comfort of the procedure.</p>
<h3>What does my gastroenterologist mean when he talks about âextra intestinal manifestationsâ of Crohnâs disease or ulcerative colitis?</h3>
<p>Although the stomach, small intestine and colon are the areas of the body that are most commonly involved with inflammatory bowel disease, patients can develop symptoms outside of the GI tract that are due to their inflammatory bowel disease. How severe the symptoms are may in some cases be related to how severe the bowel disease is or may be independent of the bowel symptoms. These symptoms are generally not due to medications administered for the bowel disease. The table below indicates some of the most common extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

<h3>What are the treatment options for Ulcerative colitis and Crohnâs disease?</h3>
<p>There are a variety of medications available to treat both ulcerative colitis and Crohnâs disease. Important pediatric considerations for medical therapy include long term side effects of the medications especially with regards to growth, bone disease such as osteoporosis (decreased calcium in the bone), development of cataracts in the eyes from medications such as steroids and a small risk of developing certain types of cancer with some medications or as a result of having chronic inflammatory bowel disease over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Medications used for pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease include the following:</p>

<p>There are a variety of nutritional options also available for patients with Crohnâs disease and it has been shown that disease activity appears to decrease if patients are able to significantly increase their caloric intake through the use of standard or specialized diets. Supplementation with folic acid, calcium and Vitamin D in patients with decreased bone calcium is also helpful in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Can surgery cure ulcerative colitis or Crohnâs disease?<br>
  </strong><br>
  Surgery is curative for ulcerative colitis, but not for Crohnâs disease. Surgery is usually performed for disease that does not get better despite medications, if severe medication side effects develop or for other complications of the underlying inflammatory bowel disease. Children undergoing removal of their colon for ulcerative colitis can have a pouch fashioned of small intestine that serves as a reservoir for stool and takes the place of the rectum. Children undergoing surgery for Crohn's disease generally do so for development of a specific complication of their disease or their medication. Because Crohnâs disease always comes back following surgery patients are usually continued on maintenance medications following surgery to cut down how quickly or how severely the disease comes back. Also the amount of bowel removed is limited in patients with Crohns disease in order to prevent additional problems with absorption of nutrients after surgery. Patients still require regular follow up with their pediatric gastroenterologist or their gastroenterologist after surgery for either ulcerative colitis or Crohnâs disease.</p>

<h2>DIARRHEA</h2>
<p>Diarrhea is a very common problem in children younger than age five. In developing or non-industrialized countries, multiple episodes of diarrhea can lead to serious problems such as malnutrition (poor nutrition). In the United States and Canada, young children have an average of two episodes of diarrhea per year.</p>
<h3>What is acute diarrhea?</h3>
<p>Acute diarrhea often called acute gastroenteritis by physicians is when stools are softer and more frequent then normal, (usually more than three bowel movements each day for less than 3 weeks total). Diarrhea may be due to infections with bacteria, viruses or parasites. Diarrhea is more common in children attending day care and is usually due to a virus. While cases of diarrhea due to infection are usually mild and go away on their own, it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated from loss of body fluid in diarrheal stools.</p>
<h3>What is dehydration and how can I tell if my child is starting to develop this?</h3>
<p>Dehydration is when someone is unable to take in sufficient fluid orally to meet their daily requirements and compensate for losses in their stools. Physicians can determine if someone is dehydrated and how severely they are dehydrated by examining them. Parents can watch for signs of dehydration by checking how often their child is passing urine, determining if they are able to cry with tears, or have dry lips. Figuring out how much a child is urinating may be difficult if an infant is in diapers, and the urine is mixed with loose bowel movements. Children often become fussy with decreased energy level.</p>
<h3>What testing should my child have if they are having diarrhea?</h3>
<p>Diarrhea due to acute infection (acute gastroenteritis) usually does not require tests. In some cases doctors will order blood tests to determine if a child is dehydrated. Collection of stool samples (stool cultures) can be done to identify the specific cause of the diarrhea in some children, especially if they have blood in stools. Stool cultures can take from 2 to 5 days before a result is available. Stool studies can also be done to look for parasites including giardia.</p>
<h3>What can I do to treat my childâs diarrhea and dehydration?</h3>
<p>Children with mild dehydration can be treated outside of the hospital with special oral rehydration solutions (ORS) that can be purchased at the pharmacy or grocery store. Oral rehydration solutions are the best way to rehydrate a child who is able to drink and is not vomiting. Although other drinks such as juices, colas and sports drinks are frequently used, they are not a good substitute for ORS, and can actually worsen the diarrhea. Patients with more severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration may require intravenous fluids (fluids given through a vein in the arm) in the hospital.</p>
<p>In a child who is otherwise healthy, it is very important to start feeding them their regular diet as soon as possible. Breast fed infants should be nursed normally during episodes of acute gastroenteritis. Formula fed infants can continue their regular diet and older children should be re-introduced to their regular diet as soon as possible. Older children may avoid dairy initially and try a bland diet consisting of bananas, apple sauce, rice, and toast. Careful hand washing should be practiced by all family members especially after diaper changes. Rarely, antibiotics are prescribed for children with specific bacterial or parasitic illnesses, although in most cases antibiotics do not change how long the diarrhea lasts or its severity. While oral rehydration solutions can prevent dehydration, they do not decrease the number of stools or how long the diarrhea lasts. Medicines which slow down bowel movements are not recommended in children with acute diarrhea.</p>
<p>When diarrhea lasts longer than three weeks it is considered to be chronic. There are many causes of chronic diarrhea. Usually chronic diarrhea is due to a disease that causes inflammation of the bowel, but diarrhea may also be due to other causes such as malabsorption of nutrients. Common causes of chronic diarrhea are shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Diarrhea following infection (post infectious diarrhea)<br>
    Chronic nonspecific diarrhea<br>
    Celiac disease (wheat intolerance)<br>
    Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohnâs disease)<br>
    Lactose intolerance<br>
    Irritable bowel syndrome<br>
    Diarrhea after antibiotic use (antibiotic associated colitis)<br>
    Food allergies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The diagnosis of these conditions usually requires confirmatory tests. Chronic non-specific diarrhea is seen in toddlers and is usually dietary in origin, such as from drinking too much juice. It resolves by simply limiting the amount of juice intake. Celiac disease is mostly seen in Caucasian children and usually presents with chronic symptoms including diarrhea, poor weight gain, decreased energy, and abdominal distension. A child can be screened for this condition by a blood test. Inflammatory bowel disease is discussed above. Irritable bowel syndrome is a common cause of diarrhea in teenagers, although many patients will present with abdominal pain and diarrhea that alternates with constipation. Irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea are discussed elsewhere in this web-book. Antibiotic associated diarrhea is seen after antibiotic use and is thought to be due to an imbalance between the âgood and badâ bacteria in the intestine. One such bacterium is called clostridium difficile, which can be tested for in stool samples. Establishing the exact cause of chronic diarrhea may require several different tests, some of which are listed below:</p>
<p>Common tests for chronic diarrhea</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Blood tests<br>
    Stool tests<br>
    X-ray studies<br>
    Endoscopy with biopsy (EGD)<br>
    Colonoscopy with biopsy<br>
    Lactose breath hydrogen test</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Colonoscopy is usually indicated when stool studies have not identified an infection and diarrhea persists. It is most useful in distinguishing acute inflammation of the colon that gets better on its own, known as acute self limited colitis, from chronic inflammation of the bowel known as chronic colitis. Colonoscopy does not usually help to find the cause of diarrhea due to infection with the exception of diarrhea that follows antibiotic use. Colonoscopy is invaluable in making the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease and figuring out what portion of the colon is involved with the inflammation. Your physician can assist you in choosing the best treatment after determining the cause of your childâs diarrhea.</p>

<h2>CONSTIPATION</h2>
<h3>What is constipation?</h3>
<p>Constipation is defined as infrequent bowel movements, hard bowel movements, and difficulty in passing bowel movements or painful bowel movements. It is a very common problem but not always easy to treat. Children may not complain of this problem to their parents. Parents may be reluctant to talk about this problem with their family members or physicians. It is one of the most frequent reasons that children are sent to see a pediatric gastroenterologist.</p>
<h3>What is considered a normal bowel pattern?</h3>
<p><u>Infants</u>Â <br>
  The first bowel movement usually occurs within 36 hours after birth in term babies (babies born within two weeks of their expected due date). Regular or normal bowel movements can vary significantly among children, especially among infants. Breast fed infants usually have more frequent bowel movements than formula fed babies.</p>
<p><u>Children</u><br>
  Most children have from 3 bowel movements per day to 3 per week.</p>
<h3>What causes constipation?</h3>
<p>Any change in a child's normal routine including a change in diet, a change in activity level or a different bathroom can cause constipation. Although it can start without any clear cause, there are certain times when a child is more likely to become constipated:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When solid foods are introduced as an infant<br>
    During toilet training<br>
    At the start of school<br>
    Birth of a sibling<br>
    Parents separating or divorcing<br>
    Move to a new place</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever bowel movements become hard, passing them becomes a painful and unpleasant experience. The child then usually tries to avoid passing bowel movements by holding it. This may eventually lead to larger, harder stools that worsen the situation. The children may cross their legs, stand on toes, or squeeze their buttocks together to try to avoid passing a bowel movement. Many times parents misinterpret these behaviors as straining to pass stools when in reality the children are trying not to have a bowel movement. These behaviors are called retentive withholding.</p>
<h3>Who is likely to develop chronic constipation?</h3>
<p>It is slightly more common in boys than girls. About 25-50% of children with constipation will have a family member with similar problems. Children whose development is delayed and those born with problems affecting the anus or rectum are more likely to suffer from chronic constipation, as do those with attention deficit disorder.</p>
<h3>What happens when my child is constipated?</h3>
<p>Constipation may be associated with stomachaches or pain in other parts of the abdomen. Constipation can result in tears of the anus called anal fissures. These cause blood in the bowel movements. Because stools may be painful to pass over an anal tear, children who have these tears may develop withholding behavior as described above. Withholding can result in chronic constipation, soiling of the underwear with stool and even difficulty walking. Soiling is usually an indication of rectal impaction with stool. It often occurs when the child is relaxed such as in a warm bathtub or sleeping and is not withholding. Soft, âclay-likeâ stool then leaks around the ball of impacted stool in the rectum. Children who are withholding their bowel movements often have a decreased appetite and activity level.</p>
<h3>Is my child's constipation a sign that they have another disease?</h3>
<p>In over 90% of children, constipation is not associated with other diseases. There are however certain 'red flags' or worrisome characteristics that should alert the physician that another underlying disease should be considered and tested for. Diseases that can have constipation as one of their symptoms include:</p>
<p>Hirschsprung's disease - a condition where the nerves of the large intestine (colon) are not properly formed at birth<br>
  Thyroid problems- usually underactive thyroid<br>
  Celiac disease- a severe wheat intolerance<br>
  Lead poisoning<br>
  Hormonal problems that cause abnormal blood calcium levels</p>
<p>Constipation can also be a side effect of a medicine that the child is taking for another condition.</p>
<h3>When should my child see a specialist about their constipation?</h3>
<p>If constipation does not go away or does not get better after the treatment that your pediatrician prescribes, seeing a pediatric gastroenterologist can be helpful. These specialists will obtain a detailed history and perform a physical examination to distinguish constipation that is due to withholding behavior or from constipation due to an underlying disease. While most children do not need any tests, your physician is the best judge to decide which test if any is necessary and to provide the most information about the cause of your childâs constipation.</p>
<h3>What types of tests might my child have to determine what is causing their constipation?</h3>
<p>Your doctor may suggest one or more of the following special tests for constipation:</p>
<p>Plain x-ray of the abdomen (also known as a KUB)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is a single or set of x-rays that can give your physician a rough idea if there is a lot of stool present. It may also indicate if the colon is dilated. This type of x-ray is also obtained prior to a barium enema which is described below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anorectal manometry or motility test</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This test determines if the nerves and muscles responsible for passing a bowel movement are working together. It is performed by inserting a very small balloon at the end of a catheter into the rectum and blowing up the balloon. The response to inflating the balloon determines if the nerves and muscles are working together properly. This test is used to diagnose Hirschsprungâs disease. Normal relaxation of the anal muscles, known as the anal sphincter, after inflation of the balloon means that a patient does not have Hirschsprung's disease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barium enema</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is an x-ray test where barium or another type of contrast is inserted via a catheter into the rectum and x-rays of the abdomen are taken. The test may or may not require a special bowel preparation to clean out the bowel before the test. This test is used to diagnose a blockage in the intestine or an area that may be narrowed or abnormal. It is also used in the diagnosis of Hirschsprungâs disease. This test is being used less frequently to diagnose Hirschsprungâs disease than it has been in previous years because of the availability of other simpler types of tests such as anorectal manometry that is described above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rectal biopsy</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is a test where a small (pinch) biopsy is performed from the lining of the rectum to determine if normal nerve cells are present in its walls. The sample of tissue that is obtained is examined under the microscope. This test is being used less frequently than it has been in previous years because of the availability of anorectal manometry testing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transit study or marker study</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This test is performed to determine if the reason for constipation is due to slow movement throughout the colon or just in the last part of the colon known as the rectum. Plastic markers, which can be seen on x-ray, are swallowed and then several x-rays are performed over the next 4-7 days to determine how long it takes them to pass through the GI tract. Patients with normal motility pass the majority (&gt;80%) of the markers within 5 days. If the markers are not passed but are found to remain throughout the colon, this suggests slowing of the entire colon. If the markers do not pass and are clustered in the rectum, this may indicate a problem in the rectum only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Colonoscopy</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is a scope test. This test is usually not indicated for the evaluation of routine constipation in children. This test may be helpful if children have blood in their bowel movements not due to a fissure or straining or for placing a colonic manometry catheter (see below).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Colonic manometry</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is a specialized test done in children who have continued problems with intractable constipation despite adequate medical therapy. It involves placing a catheter at the time of colonoscopy to determine whether there are normal contractions in all parts of the colon. The test requires a period of prolonged monitoring of the contractions of the colon after placement of the catheter. This test is used to establish the diagnosis of colonic pseudo-obstruction in children, a very rare condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How is constipation treated in children?</h3>
<p>The best way to treat constipation is a combination of education, behavioral modification, dietary modification and non-habit forming medications. If there is an impaction of stool, which means a very large amount of stool in the rectum, it needs to be evacuated first either by an enema or by a medication given by mouth. Patients are then started on a maintenance medication for a few months to soften the stools, and a program of bowel retraining is started. The child is advised to sit on the potty after every major meal for 5-10 minutes and try to have a bowel movement. Positive reinforcement (reward) is provided if the child has a stool in the potty. Behavioral modification may be needed in some patients. Some children, especially boys, tend to get so involved in sports or playing video games that they ignore the âurgeâ to have a bowel movement. Postponing the event makes things worse in the long run. The goal of treatment is to make having a bowel movement pain free for the child by softening the stools. Consistency in treatment is crucial for success.</p>
<p>Dietary and lifestyle changes may be helpful in improving a patientâs symptoms. Increasing dietary fiber over 1 to 2 weeks is often helpful, by increasing bulk that then stimulates colon contractions. This strategy may take a while to work and should not be tried in children with severe constipation as it may make it worse. High fiber foods include:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Bran<br>
    Fresh fruits: apricots, apples, pears, melons<br>
    Fresh vegetables: asparagus, beans, broccoli, carrots, beets, cauliflower, other greens<br>
    Whole wheat products: cereals, breads, and pasta.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fiber supplements are available if parents find their children will not eat more fiber in their diet. There is little information to recommend one product over another. A patient may have to try several before finding one that is acceptable and that they are willing to take regularly. Fiber supplements are given two times a day and must be taken with a sufficient amount of water. Some patients may notice increased passage of gas while on fiber supplements. Increasing a patientâs physical activity is also helpful to promote regular bowel movements.</p>
<h3>What types of medications are used in children?</h3>
<p>If constipation does not get better with dietary and behavior modifications, stool softeners are indicated. The two most common stool softeners used in children are Miralax and lactulose.</p>
<p><u>Miralax</u>Â (polyethylene glycol) has become the most widely used medication for treating constipation in children. It is a white powder that can be dissolved in juice or water and does not get absorbed. It is tasteless, safe and non-habit forming. They have soft, more frequent stools on this medication.</p>
<p><u>Lactulose</u>Â is a laxative that is made of a sugar that is not absorbed by the intestine. It works by pulling water into the bowel movements that helps to keep them soft. Because it is not absorbed, lactulose is not associated with side effects except for increased gassiness and diarrhea if the dose of the medicine is too high. Lactulose is not a stimulant and therefore the bowel does not become dependent on it.</p>
<p><u>Milk of Magnesia</u>Â is a mild stimulant laxative that may be used at bedtime in children with mild constipation. It is available over the counter without a prescription. The major limiting factor in its use in children is its taste, even though it is now available in different flavors.</p>
<p><u>Mineral oil</u>, which is given mixed with juice or milk, acts as a lubricant to allow bowel movements to pass easier. This type of medication is particularly useful in toddlers who withhold their bowel movements. Older children may have leakage of the oil in their underwear that may not be acceptable. This problem usually goes away with decreasing the dose of mineral oil. Mineral oil should not be given to children with neurologic problems who are at high risk for aspiration. Flavored forms of mineral oil are also available.</p>
<p>Stimulant laxatives, such as senna or bisacodyl (dulcolax), that cause the colon to have strong contractions, are not popular with pediatricians due to the concerns that they may damage the intestinal nerves, if given over prolonged periods.</p>
<h3>Is surgery ever performed for treatment of constipation?</h3>
<p>Surgery is rarely needed for constipation. The exception to this is Hirschsprungâs disease, which is treated with surgical removal of the portion of the bowel where there are no normal nerves. Also, there are rare cases when children develop a dilated and floppy colon that has no normal contractions, a condition called pseudo-obstruction. These children also may benefit from removing the affected colon surgically. Recently special surgical procedures, such as cecostomy (opening between the bowel and skin which allows drainage of stool), have been devised to help children with spinal cord abnormalities that have severe problems with constipation.</p>

<p>A  Gastroenterologist is a specialist in gastrointestinal diseases  and has received special training in colonoscopy. Gastroenterologists  perform more colonoscopies by far than any other  specialty. Non-gastroenterologists are five times more  likely to miss colorectal cancer during colonoscopy than  Gastroenterologists (1).</p>
<h3>What training in colonoscopy did the doctor  receive?</h3>
<p>Proper  training in colonoscopy is necessary not only to increase the chance  that the procedure can be completed and any necessary treatments  applied, but also to be sure that abnormal results can be  properly interpreted. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy  recommends that persons performing colonoscopy complete a  fellowship program in gastroenterology or receive training  in colonoscopy during a surgical residency.</p>
<h3>How many colonoscopies has the doctor  performed?<br>
How many perforations has the doctor had?</h3>
<p>Many  Gastroenterologists have performed many thousands of colonoscopies.  A colonoscopist should know the rate at which their  procedures have been associated with a perforation or making a  hole in the colon. This rate should certainly be below 1 in 500  examinations and many experts have rates of perforation well below  1 in 1000.</p>
<h3>How often does your doctor complete the  colonoscopy?</h3>
<p>Experienced  colonoscopists reach the very beginning of the large  intestine (the cecum) in more than 90% of cases and in more  than 95% of patients who are undergoing screening. Screening  is the process of checking people who have no symptoms  for colon polyps and cancer.</p>
<h3>Can the doctor remove polyps from your colon?</h3>
<p>Persons  performing colonoscopy must be trained in the removal of polyps.  Although even Gastroenterologists may refer a patient with a  large polyp to a special expert in the removal of polyps, a trained  colonoscopist can remove the overwhelming majority of routine  polyps.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The pancreas is  an organ within the abdomen behind the stomach. The pancreas has two main  functions: it helps produce enzymes that aid in digestion and also secretes  insulin that helps the body control blood sugar levels. Within the pancreas,  there are specialized cells called acinar cells that are responsible for  producing the digestive enzymes that help us break down fats and proteins. Also  within the pancreas, there are specialized cells termed islets which make insulin  and other hormones. </p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/pancreatitis-acute-and-chronic/" class="faqquestion">What is Pancreatitis?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Acute  pancreatitis is a condition characterized by abrupt inflammation of the  pancreas characterized by swelling and at times even destruction of pancreatic  tissue. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and  excessive alcohol consumption. Other causes include smoking, high triglyceride  levels, high calcium levels, certain medications, abdominal trauma, viral infections,  structural anatomic anomalies and genetic abnormalities. Chronic pancreatitis occurs  when there is irreversible scar tissue that forms in the pancreas as a result  of ongoing inflammation. Chronic pancreatitis can lead to impaired digestion of  food and diabetes mellitus. The most common causes of chronic pancreatitis are  excessive consumption of alcohol, heavy smoking, and recurrent episodes of  acute pancreatitis for any number of reasons including genetic mutations. However,  the cause is unknown in nearly a third of patients, despite an extensive  evaluation.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/pancreatitis-acute-and-chronic/" class="faqquestion">What is the Treatment for Pancreatitis?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The principles  for the treatment of acute pancreatitis are: 1) rest the pancreas by  restricting oral intake of food; 2) administer intravenous fluids to maintain  an adequate blood volume; and 3) pain medication. If alcohol is the cause of  pancreatitis, strict abstinence from alcohol is recommended. Surgical removal  of the gallbladder is indicated when the pancreatitis results from gallstones  or gallbladder sludge. If the bile duct is blocked by a gallstone, an ERCP may  be required to remove the gallstone. </p>
<p>The most  important goal in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis is to provide pain  relief and prevent progression of disease. If pain is difficult to control, you  may be referred to a chronic pain specialist. At times, relief of pain may  require endoscopic, radiologic, or surgical treatment. If your pancreas is  found to be unable to provide sufficient enzymes for adequate digestion, you  may benefit from enzyme supplements. Also, if your blood sugar level is very  high and not controlled by diet or oral medications, insulin may be required. It  is important to avoid alcohol. Complete sessation of smoking is recommended as it  is a risk factor for progression of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.  In a few select patients, there is also the option of surgically removing the  pancreas to reduce pain and transplanting the islets from the pancreas into the  liver to potentially prevent diabetes. Since chronic pancreatitis is also a  risk factor for pancreatic cancer, you should speak to your provider about ways  to help reduce your risk of developing pancreatic cancer. </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/wilson-disease/" class="faqquestion">
What is Wilson disease?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Wilson disease is an inherited disorder that causes too much copper to accumulate in the liver, brain, and other vital organs. Copper plays a key role in the development of healthy nerves, bones, collagen and the skin pigment. A small amount of copper obtained from food is needed to stay healthy, but too much copper is poisonous. In Wilson disease, a genetic defect prevents the body from getting rid of extra copper. Wilson disease is named after Dr Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson (1878-1937), the British neurologist who first described the condition in 1912.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/wilson-disease/" class="faqquestion">What causes Wilson disease?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Normally, copper is absorbed from food, and any excess is excreted through bile, a substance produced in the liver, which flows out of the body through the gut. People who have Wilson disease cannot release copper from the liver at a normal rate, due to a mutation in the gene on chromosome 13 that contains the blueprint for the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B), which helps transport copper into the bile. The copper accumulates in the liver, sometimes to toxic levels and when the copper storage capacity of the liver is exceeded, copper is released into the bloodstream and travels to other organsâincluding the brain, kidneys, and eyes.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/wilson-disease/" class="faqquestion">Who gets Wilson disease?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Individuals who carry one normal copy and one abnormal copy of the ATP7B gene do not develop any symptoms (they are carriers). If a child inherits the abnormal gene from both parents, they may develop Wilson disease. The inheritance pattern of Wilson disease is autosomal recessive. Wilson disease occurs on an average in about 1 per 30,000 people worldwide. Most people with Wilson disease have no known family history of the disease. A personâs chances of having Wilson disease increase if one or both parents have Wilson disease. If both parents carry an abnormal gene for Wilson disease, there is a 25% chance in each pregnancy that the child will have the disorder.</p>
<p>Wilson disease affects men and women equally. It is most common in eastern Europeans, Sicilians, and southern Italians, but may occur in any ethnic group.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/wilson-disease/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of Wilson disease?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Symptoms usually appear between ages 5 to 35, but new cases have been reported in people aged 2 to 72 years. Liver failure and damage to the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord) are the most predominant, and the most dangerous, effects of the disorder. If not caught and treated early, Wilson disease can be fatal.</p>
<p>Patients with liver problems tend to come to medical attention earlier, generally as children or teenagers, than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, who tend to be in their twenties or older. Some are identified only because relatives have been diagnosed with Wilson disease; many of these patients, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not been diagnosed with it.</p>
<p>A buildup of copper in the liver may cause ongoing chronic liver disease, which can progress to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver). Most patients develop signs and symptoms that accompany chronic liver disease, including fatigue, abdominal pain and yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Later in the disease, bleeding in the gut, which can show up either as vomiting of red blood or black colored stools (melena) can occur. Other signs and symptoms may include swelling due to fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites) or legs (edema), an enlarged spleen and a tendency to bruise easily, and anemia. Confusion (hepatic encephalopathy) due to inability of the liver to clear toxins including ammonia can occur which can progress to coma. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of liver cancer, this risk is relatively low in patients with Wilson disease.</p>
<p>Rarely, acute liver failure (rapid loss of liver function over days to weeks, without scarring of the liver) can occur. About 5% of all patients are diagnosed only when they develop acute liver failure. This leads to abnormalities in protein production and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein production manifests as blood coagulation problems causing tendency to bleed easily all over the body. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the patient develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Neuropsychiatric symptoms:</strong>Â About half of patients with Wilson disease have neurological or psychiatric problems. Most patients initially have mild cognitive deterioration and clumsiness, as well as changes in behavior, problems with speech, swallowing, or physical coordination, tremors or uncontrolled movements, muscle stiffness and spasms, unsteady gait and drooling. Seizures and migraine appear to be more common in Wilson disease. Wilson disease can cause abrupt personality changes and inappropriate behavior. Children with the disease are sometimes misdiagnosed as having behavioral problems because they behave erratically or perform poorly in school.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Eye, kidney and bone problems:</strong>Â Many people with Wilson disease, even those who don't have other signs and symptoms, develop a distinctive, golden brown pigmentation around their corneas (Kayser-Fleischer ring). Caused by copper deposits, Kayser-Fleischer rings are often discovered during a routine eye exam. Wilson disease can also interfere with the filtering function of the kidneys and can lead to weak, brittle bones (osteoporosis). The disease can also lead to kidney stones.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Heart problems:</strong>Â cardiomyopathy (weakness of the heart muscle) is a rare but recognized problem in Wilson disease; it may lead to heart failure (fluid accumulation due to decreased pump function) and cardiac arrhythmias (episodes of irregular and/or abnormally fast or slow heart beat).</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Hormonal problems:</strong>Â Copper accumulation can lead to hypoparathyroidism (failure of the parathyroid glands leading to low calcium levels), infertility and frequent spontaneous loss of a pregnancy (spontaneous abortion).</li>
</ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/wilson-disease/" class="faqquestion">How is Wilson disease diagnosed?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Wilson disease is diagnosed through a combination of physical examination and laboratory tests.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eye exam: Using a microscope with a high-intensity light source (slit lamp), an ophthalmologist checks your eyes for Kayser-Fleischer rings. Kayser-Fleischer rings are present in almost all people with Wilson disease who show signs of neurologic damage but are present in only 50 percent of those with signs of liver damage alone.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Blood and urine tests: Laboratory tests are done to measure the amount of ceruloplasmin (the protein that transports copper in the blood) and copper in the blood, and to test the amount of copper excreted in the urine in a 24-hour period. Most people with Wilson disease will have a lower than normal level of copper in the blood and a lower level of corresponding ceruloplasmin. A 24-hour urine collection will show increased copper in the urine in most patients who display symptoms.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Liver biopsy: In this procedure, a small sample of tissue is removed from the liver and examined in a laboratory for excess copper. The analysis of biopsied liver tissue with a microscope detects liver damage, which often shows a pattern unique to Wilson disease.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If there are neurological symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is usually performed; this shows structural changes in the part of the brain called the basal ganglia.</p>

<p>There is no totally reliable test for Wilson disease, but levels of ceruloplasmin and copper in the blood, as well of the amount of copper excreted in the urine during a 24 hour period, are together used to form an impression of the amount of copper in the body. The combination of neurological symptoms, Kayser-Fleisher rings and a low ceruloplasmin level is considered sufficient for the diagnosis of Wilson disease. In many cases, however, further tests are needed. The âgold standardâ or most ideal test is a liver biopsy.</p>
<p>Genetic testing may help diagnose Wilson disease in some people, particularly in those where a close relative has been found to have Wilson disease. A blood test called DNA mutation analysis is available at a limited number of medical centers but is not generally commercially available. This test can identify the genetic mutations that cause Wilson disease. Mutation analysis of the ATP7B gene, as well as other genes linked to copper accumulation in the liver, may be performed. Once a mutation is confirmed, it allows screening of asymptomatic family members for the disease and beginning treatment before debilitating symptoms arise. It must be remembered that whenever genetic testing is done, genetic counseling must be available and informed consent should be obtained.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/wilson-disease/" class="faqquestion">What is the treatment of Wilson disease? (Table 1)</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Wilson disease is a very treatable condition. With proper therapy, disease progress can be halted and oftentimes symptoms can be improved. Left untreated, Wilson disease may be fatal.</p>

<p>Wilson disease requires lifelong treatment to reduce and control the amount of copper in the body. Once treatment starts, the disease stops progressing and many signs and symptoms improve. But some problems may take time to resolve. Other problems â especially liver scarring and certain neurological or psychological symptoms â may not be completely reversible.</p>
<p>Treatment is initially aimed at removing excess accumulated copper and subsequently to prevent its reaccumulation.</p>
<p>Initial therapy includes the removal of excess copper, a reduction of copper intake, and the treatment of any liver or central nervous system damage.</p>
<p>Excess copper is removed by means of chelating drugs, which are chemicals used to bind metals and minerals. These orally ingested drugs release copper from organs into the bloodstream, which is then filtered out by the kidneys and excreted in urine. The following drugs have been approved and used for treatment of Wilson disease.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Penicillamine (Cuprimine, Depen).</strong>Â Penicillamine was the first copper chelating drug approved for use in Wilson disease. Although it is an effective treatment, penicillamine can cause serious side effects, including skin problems, bone marrow suppression, kidney problems, vitamin B-6 deficiency and worsening of neurological symptoms and birth defects.<br>
  <br>
 Penicillamine should not be taken by people with kidney disease or by those who are allergic to penicillin.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Trientine (Syprine).</strong>Â Another chelating agent, trientine also binds to copper and helps eliminate it from the body. Because it is less toxic than penicillamine, many doctors consider it a first-line therapy, especially in people with liver or neurological symptoms. Trientine also binds to iron, and taking iron supplements can reduce the drug's effectiveness.<br>
  <br>
    A potential major side effect of both drugs is that neurologic symptoms can become worseâa possible result of the newly released copper becoming reabsorbed by the central nervous system.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Tetrathiomolybdate</strong>Â is another chelating drug that is under investigation for initial treatment of Wilson disease. Thus far, it has not caused the neurological worsening often associated with penicillamine and even with trientine.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Zinc acetate.</strong>Â Working differently from chelating drugs, the mineral zinc helps prevent copper from being absorbed in the gut. Zinc has few side effects, but it is slower acting than either penicillamine or trientine and so is usually considered an initial treatment only for pregnant women, for people without symptoms or liver damage, or for those who cannot tolerate stronger medications. Its role is mainly in maintenance therapy.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Maintenance therapy</strong>Â begins when symptoms improve and tests show that copper has been reduced to a safe level. Maintenance therapy typically includes taking zinc and low doses of either d-penicillamine or trientine hydrochloride. Blood and urine should be monitored by a health care provider to ensure treatment is keeping copper at a safe level.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Liver transplantation is the last resort treatment and may be the only option in some scenarios. It is used mainly in patients with acute liver failure who fail to respond to medical treatment, or in patients with advanced chronic liver disease.</p>

<p>People with Wilson disease should reduce their dietary copper intake. They should not eat shellfish or liver, as these foods may contain high levels of copper. Other foods high in copperâincluding mushrooms, nuts, and chocolateâshould be avoided during initial therapy but, in most cases, may be eaten in moderation during maintenance therapy. People with Wilson disease should have their drinking water checked for copper content and should not take multivitamins that contain copper. In patients with chronic liver disease due to Wilson disease, alcohol ingestion should be avoided.</p>
<p>If the disorder is detected early and treated effectively, people with Wilson disease can enjoy good health.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>In order to understand Barrettâs esophagus, it is useful to understand the normal appearance of the esophagus. In the normal esophagus, the tissue lining appears pale pink and smooth. These flat square cells, called âsquamousâ (Latin for square) cells, make up the normal lining of the esophagus. See <strong>Cartoons 1 and 2</strong>.

<p>In contrast, Barrettâs esophagus is a salmon-colored lining in the esophagus (see <strong>Cartoon 3</strong>), made up of cells that are similar to cells found in the small intestine and are called âspecialized intestinal metaplasia.â

<p>Barrettâs esophagus is more commonly seen in people who have frequent, persistent heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD symptoms include heartburn (burning under your breast bone) that may wake you up at night, occur after meals or in between, and may temporarily improve with antacids. Acid regurgitation, or the experience of sour or bitter-tasting fluid coming back up into your mouth, is also a GERD symptom. Some people do not have any of these symptoms and are still at risk of developing Barrettâs esophagus.

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/barretts-esophagus/" class="faqquestion">What are the Risk Factors for Barrettâs Esophagus?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Age, male sex, Caucasian ethnicity and heartburn symptoms of longer than 10 yearsâ duration are risk factors for Barrettâs esophagus. Heartburn, tobacco smoking, and obesity are risk factors for developing esophageal carcinoma. Tobacco use (especially chewing tobacco) and alcohol consumption are much stronger risk factors for a different type of cancer: squamous cell cancer of the esophagus. Tobacco slightly increases a personâs chance of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma. </p>

<p>Most people with Barrettâs esophagus are in their 60âs at the time of diagnosis. It is thought that most people who are diagnosed with Barrettâs have had it for 10 to 20 years before diagnosis.</p>

<p>Men are 3 to 4 times more likely to have Barrettâs esophagus compared to women. Caucasians are about 10 times more likely to have Barrettâs esophagus than persons of African American ethnic background.</p>

<p>Although people who experience weekly heartburn or acid regurgitation are 64 times more likely to get esophageal adenocarcinoma than people who have never experienced these symptoms, 40% of people with esophageal adenocarcinoma deny ever experiencing heartburn. Why these people developed esophageal adenocarcinoma remains a mystery.</p>
</div>
</li>  
 
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/barretts-esophagus/" class="faqquestion">What is the Risk of Getting Esophageal Cancer?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>We now know that patients with Barrettâs esophagus have a low risk of esophageal cancer. A person with Barrettâs esophagus has less than a 1 in 200 chance per year of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma. The overall risk of cancer may increase as the years go by, but more than 90% of people with Barrettâs esophagus WILL NOT develop cancer. Therefore, Barrettâs esophagus is a condition that you need to know about and take care of if you have it. However, the vast majority of patients with Barrettâs will never get cancer. </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/barretts-esophagus/" class="faqquestion">When Should You See a Doctor about Barrettâs Esophagus?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>You should ask a doctor about Barrettâs esophagus if you have the risk factors listed earlier (male sex, age 50 or over, Caucasian ethnic group, GERD symptoms of longer than 10 yearsâ duration). If you have alarm symptoms such as trouble swallowing, losing weight without trying, blood in your stool, vomiting, persistent symptoms despite medical therapy, or new chest pain, you should discuss your symptoms with your doctor and have an endoscopic examination.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/barretts-esophagus/" class="faqquestion">What Type of Tests are Needed to Evaluate Barrettâs Esophagus?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Endoscopy is the test of choice for Barrettâs esophagus. During endoscopy, a thin tube with a light and camera on the end are run through your mouth, down your throat and into your stomach. Biopsies, meaning small pieces of tissue can be collected to look at under the microscope. In Barrettâs, tissue is the issue. Tissue, showing a certain abnormal cell type, is necessary to make the diagnosis of Barrettâs esophagus, and is one of the keys to management of Barrettâs.</p>
<p>An upper GI barium study can be helpful in finding strictures (areas of narrowing), usually causing trouble swallowing. Barium studies are not useful for diagnosing Barrettâs esophagus, because it is a diagnosis that requires biopsies of the tissues to make.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/barretts-esophagus/" class="faqquestion">What are the Treatment Options for Barrettâs Esophagus?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Generally, doctors treat the symptoms of GERD, not Barrettâs esophagus specifically. Barrettâs is an acquired disorder, meaning it develops over time and is not present at birth. It is usually diagnosed around age 60, although we estimate that half of people with Barrettâs esophagus have it by age 40.</p>
<p>Treatment for GERD symptoms are listed in the GERD section of this web page and elsewhere on the ACG Web Book for patients. Generally, this will include antacids, histamine receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors. Surgery is also an option. The large majority of patients with Barrettâs esophagus will be treated with a proton pump inhibitor.</p>
<p>The proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) include: esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex), omeprazole powder (Zegerid), and dexlansoprazole (Dexilant). With regard to the optimal way to take a proton pump inhibitor, for most brands it is suggested that you take your medication half an hour before a meal. Most other pills can be taken along with PPIâs, except for antacids, Carafateï¢, and Questranï¢. Antacids, Carafateï¢ and Questranï¢ bind almost everything they come in contact with, so if you are on these medicines, you should not be taking them at the same time as other medicines in the first place. </p>
<p>PPIs work by turning off the pumps in the lining of your stomach that pump acid into the stomach. Eating food 20 to 60 minutes after taking your pill on an empty stomach activates millions of these acid pumps which are then turned off by the medication. This is the key for the best dosing of a PPI.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/barretts-esophagus/" class="faqquestion">Management of Barrettâs esophagus</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>During endoscopy, your doctor will get multiple biopsies every 1 to 2 cm (one half to one inch) along the length of your Barrettâs esophagus segment. How the biopsies look on a microscope slide influences your management. </p>

<p>The key to the management of Barrettâs esophagus is the level of dysplasia that the biopsies show. âDysplasiaâ is how much precancerous changes the cells have. âNo Dysplasiaâ means that the Barrettâs cells show no precancerous changes. Low-grade dysplasia means that the cells show some of the early characteristics of cancer. High-grade dysplasia means that the cells show more advanced changes of cancer. The worse the dysplasia, the higher the risk that the Barrettâs will go on to cancer. </p>

<p>All of our cells are programmed to die. We are constantly making new cells while old cells slough off. For example, dandruff is old dead scalp cells that have dried up and flaked off. Just like your skin on the outside of your body, the lining of the esophagus is skin on the inside of your body. Cells keep their DNA in their nucleus. Cancer is DNA that has lost control of how fast the cells divide, or how quickly they die. In cancer, cells grow and grow without dying.</p>

<p>When cells are changing from normal to cancer, they go through the steps of dysplasia outlined above.</p>

<p><strong>No Dysplasia</strong><br>
If a diagnosis of Barrettâs esophagus is made, ideally there should be NO dysplasia. See <strong>Cartoon 4 and Figure 2</strong>.</p>

</table>

<p>In biopsies with no dysplasia, the nuclei are small, organized and located at the base (bottom) of the Barrettâs cell. </p>
<p>Most people with Barrettâs esophagus and no dysplasia will need to undergo future endoscopies to assure there is no progression of the condition. When the next endoscopy occurs is usually based on recommendations by groups of experts whose opinion is endorsed The American College of Gastroenterology. Follow up endoscopy for Barrettâs without dysplasia is usually recommended at 3-5 years, but your doctor will help decide what is most appropriate for you. </p>
<p><strong>Low Grade Dysplasia</strong><br>
If biopsies are found to have low-grade dysplasia (<strong>Cartoon 5 and Figure 3</strong>), where the nuclei are still small but somewhat disorganized, several things should happen: First, the doctor should have a second pathologist also look at your biopsies, because low-grade dysplasia can be a hard diagnosis for a pathologist to make correctly, and sometimes there is disagreement among pathologists that might require yet another opinion to resolve.</p>

</table>

<p>If the diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia is confirmed, it is recommended that otherwise healthy people consider getting endoscopic treatment to get rid of their Barrettâs esophagus. The most common way of doing this is a process called radiofrequency ablation. In radiofrequency ablation treatments, heat is applied to the precancerous tissue to kill those cells so that normal healthy cells can grow there instead. Studies demonstrate that these treatments can lower the patientâs chance of ever getting cancer. Another acceptable option if low-grade dysplasia is found is to continue to perform endoscopies to monitor the condition, without doing any ablation treatments. If this option is selected, the repeat endoscopy is usually performed 1 year after the first one.</p>

<P><strong>High Grade Dysplasia</strong><br>
High-grade dysplasia (<strong>Cartoon 7, Figure 5</strong>) is thought to be the stage that occurs before esophageal cancer. However high-grade dysplasia can regress to low-grade dysplasia. If diagnosed with high-grade dysplasia the biopsies should be examined again by a pathologist who specializes in diseases of the esophagus.</p>

<p>If a diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia is confirmed, it is recommended that the patient undergo endoscopic treatments to get rid of the Barrettâs esophagus. As above, the most commonly used treatment in high-grade dysplasia is radiofrequency ablation. Surgical removal of the esophagus can also be performed for high-grade dysplasia; however, this is done more rarely now that effective endoscopic treatments are available.</p>
<p>Barrettâs esophagus is best managed by doctors with an interest in this disease, including gastroenterologists, esophagus surgeons and gastroenterology pathologists. </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of AAT deficiency?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>This deficiency may predispose patients to several illnesses. It most commonly manifests as lung disease or emphysema, less commonly as liver disease, or more rarely, as a skin condition called panniculitis. Panniculitis is characterized by hardened skin with painful lumps or patches and is due to an inflammation in the fatty tissue under the skin. It can occur in both children and adults.</p>

<p>Lung disease is the most frequent cause of disability and early death among adults affected by the disease.</p>

<p>The first signs and symptoms of lung disease caused by alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency usually manifest between ages 20 and 50. The earliest symptoms are shortness of breath following mild activity, reduced ability to exercise, and wheezing. Other signs and symptoms can include: unintentional weight loss, recurring respiratory infections, fatigue and vision abnormalities.</p>

<p>Advanced lung disease leads to emphysema or chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), in which small air sacs in the lung are damaged. Characteristic features of emphysema include difficulty breathing, and a barrel-shaped chest.</p>

<p>Smoking or exposure to tobacco smoke accelerates the appearance of symptoms and damage to the lungs. AAT deficiency is also a major reason that patients undergo lung transplants.</p>

<p>Liver disease can affect both children and adults. About 10 percent of infants and 15 percent of adults with AAT deficiency develop scarring or cirrhosis of the liver because of progressive liver damage. In newborns, the typical symptoms of AAT deficiency are jaundice, swelling of the abdomen, and poor feeding. Symptoms of AAT deficiency may also appear in late childhood or adulthood and include fatigue, poor appetite, swelling of the abdomen and legs or abnormal liver tests and jaundice. It can cause progressive scarring or cirrhosis of the liver and is the leading genetic cause of liver transplantation in children. Cirrhosis can manifest as easy bruising, fluid retention and vomiting of blood or passage of black stool because of bleeding in the gut. It can also lead to confusion, which can progress to coma.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/" class="faqquestion">What causes Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a protein that is produced mostly in the liver. Its main purpose is to destroy an enzyme called neutrophil elastase in the lungs. Neutrophil elastase is an enzyme that normally performs an important function in the lungs -it digests damaged or old cells and bacteria to promote healing. However, if left unchecked, it will also attack healthy lung tissue. AAT, in sufficient amounts, will trap and destroy neutrophil elastase before it has a chance to begin damaging delicate lung tissue. Consequently, if a patient doesnât have enough AAT, the enzyme goes unchecked and attacks the lungs.</p>

<p>AAT deficiency is an inherited defect due to a mutation in the proteinase inhibitor (Pi) gene on chromosome 14, which alters the structure of the AAT molecule and prevents its release from liver cells. As a result, serum levels of AAT are decreased. The amount of AAT in the lung consequently is low which results in unchecked activity of neutrophil elastase and damage to lung tissue. This can lead to lung disease. The resultant accumulation of excess AAT in liver cells leads to injury to the liver, which can progress to cirrhosis (excess scar tissue).</p>

<p>Cigarette smoke is especially harmful to patients with AAT deficiency. In addition to increasing the inflammatory reaction in the airways, cigarette smoke directly inactivates alpha 1-antitrypsin resulting in more severe lung damage.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/" class="faqquestion">Who gets Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Everyone receives one copy of the alpha-1 antitrypsin gene (Pi gene) from each parent. The most common type of Pi gene is called the M gene, which is the non-disease causing (normal) variant. Most people have two normal copies of the Pi gene and they are said to have type PiMM. These people have normal levels of AAT in the blood. People with AAT deficiency may have one normal copy and one damaged copy, or two damaged copies of the Pi gene. There are more than 70 different types of defective alpha-1 antitrypsin genes. The most common genotype leading to liver disease is PiZZ. Routine testing for AAT should include measuring levels of AAT and the genotype of an individualâs AAT.</p>

<p>AAT deficiency has been identified in all populations, but it is most common in patients of Northern European and Iberian descent. AAT deficiency is 1 of the 3 most common lethal genetic diseases among adult white persons. In Scandinavia this disorder affects 1 in 1,500 to 3,000 individuals, but it is less common in Asian and black populations. In North America, AAT deficiency affects 1 in 5,000 to 7,000 people.</p>

<p>Current evidence suggests that there are about 100,000 people with clinically significant AAT deficiency in the United States.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/" class="faqquestion">How is AAT deficiency diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The diagnosis of AAT deficiency is made by blood tests showing the low levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin. If they are abnormally low, the next step is to identify the exact alpha-1-antitrypsin protein variants the person carries. Abnormal types of the alpha-1-antitrypsin protein can be detected using dried blood as a sample for gel electrophoresis â this is known as phenotyping. Whenever genetic testing is done, genetic counseling must be available, and informed consent should be obtained. Other tests to confirm the severity of the disease include lung function tests, chest X-rays and chest CT scans and liver function tests.</p>

<p>A liver biopsy may be performed to check for evidence of damage to the liver.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/" class="faqquestion">What is the treatment for AAT deficiency?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The most important factor in preventing disease or slowing disease progression in individuals with AAT deficiency is avoidance of risk factors. The biggest risk factor for lung disease is cigarette smoking. In addition to smoking cessation, it is important to avoid second-hand smoke, avoid infection, and avoid occupational inhaled irritant exposures. Similarly patients should be counseled regarding possible sources of liver injury such as alcohol abuse.</p>

<p>The lung-affected patients may receive intravenous infusions of alpha-1 antitrypsin, derived from donated human plasma. This augmentation therapy is thought to arrest the course of the disease and halt any further damage to the lungs. Long-term studies of the effectiveness of A1AT replacement therapy are not available. It is currently recommended that patients begin augmentation therapy only after the onset of emphysema symptoms.</p>

<p>Augmentation therapy is not appropriate for liver-affected patients; treatment of A1AD-related liver damage focuses on alleviating the symptoms of the disease. In advanced and decompensated liver disease, the only available approach is liver transplantation.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Most patients who develop ascites notice abdominal distension and rapid weight gain. Some people also develop swelling of ankles and shortness of breath from accumulation of fluid around the lungs. Additional symptoms or complication may occur and are listed below.</p>
<p><u>Abdominal pain, discomfort and difficulty breathing</u>: These may occur when too much fluid accumulates in the abdominal cavity. This may limit the ability to eat, ambulate and perform activities of daily living. </p>
<p><u>Infection</u>: This is called spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and it usually causes abdominal pain, tenderness, fever or nausea. If this is not promptly diagnosed or treated, a patient may develop kidney failure, severe infection in the blood stream or mental confusion. The diagnosis is generally made by taking a sample of the fluid from the abdominal cavity. This infection can be treated with intravenous antibiotics, and after recovery, patients will require long term treatment with antibiotics to prevent SBP from recurring. </p>
<p><u>Ascites related hernias</u>:Â Elevated intra-abdominal pressure can lead to the development of umbilical (around the bellybutton) and inguinal (groin) hernias that can cause abdominal discomfort. Surgical repair is generally avoided unless there is severe pain suggesting the intestines or tissue may be pinched or twisted along with a persistent bulge from the hernia. Surgeons who have experience in treating patients with cirrhosis should perform these operations. </p>
<p><u>Fluid accumulation in the chest</u>: This is called hepatic hydrothorax and the abdominal fluid fills into the lung cavities (mostly on your right side) in addition to the abdominal cavity. This condition may result in shortness of breath with exertion or sometimes at rest also.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Depending on how much fluid is present in the abdomen, ascites may be diagnosed by the doctor on physical examination but is usually confirmed by tests such as ultrasound or CT scan of the abdomen. In the majority of patients, the doctor will recommend that a small needle be inserted through the abdominal wall (after local anesthesia) to remove fluid to be examined in the laboratory. This test is called a paracentesis. The fluid removed will be examined for signs of infection or cancer and to determine the cause for the fluid accumulation.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The development of ascites generally suggests that the liver is not working well. The survival rate 5 years after ascites develops is only 30-40% and it is important that the patient and doctor discuss a referral to a liver specialist and a liver transplant center.</p>
<p>The most important step to treat ascites is to strictly reduce the salt intake. Salt intake is limited to to 4-5 grams per day (2,000 mg of sodium) or less. As it can be difficult to determine the salt content of various foods, it is generally recommended that a patient with ascites see a nutritionist (dietician) for advice about various foods to avoid. Patients may use salt substitute but it is essential to choose one without potassium because the potassium levels can increase with certain medications to treat ascites. It is important to discuss with the doctor or the dietician which salt substitute may be safer to use. </p>
<p>Most often, patients will require water pills (diuretics) to treat ascites. Commonly used water pills are spironolactone (Aldactone) and/or furosemide (Lasix) and their dosages are appropriately adjusted. These water pills can cause problems with blood electrolytes (levels of sodium and potassium) and as such close monitoring by blood tests may be required. It is important to realize that taking water pills is not a substitute for reducing your salt intake, as water pills will work only when they are taken together with restricted salt intake. </p>
<p>Checking body weight daily on a scale and contacting the physician whenever there is a gain of more than 10 pounds (or greater than 2 pounds per day for 3 consecutive days) is a good strategy for better management in patients with ascites.</p>
<p>When fluid accumulation cannot be treated optimally with water pills and salt restricted diet, patients may require a large amount of fluid be removed (paracentesis) for relief of symptoms. Other procedures such as having a radiologist place a shunt within the liver (called TIPS) to prevent significant fluid accumulation from ascites are available for patients who have difficult to treat ascites.Â As mentioned earlier, patients with ascites have a serious health risk and are often evaluated for liver transplantation. More than half of these patients may not survive 2-3 years without liver transplantation.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">What are gallstones?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Gallstones are collections of cholesterol, bile pigment or a combination of the two, which can form in the gallbladder or within the bile ducts of the liver. In the United States, the most common type of gallstones are made of cholesterol. Cholesterol stones form due to an imbalance in the production of cholesterol or the secretion of bile. Pigmented stones are primarily composed of bilirubin, which is a chemical produced as a result of the normal breakdown of red blood cells. Bilirubin gallstones are more common in Asia and Africa but are seen in diseases that damage red blood cells such as sickle cell anemia.</p>
</div>

</ul>
<h3>Causes</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">How do gallstones cause problems?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>If gallstones form in the biliary system they can cause blockage of the bile ducts, which normally drain bile from the gallbladder and liver. Occasionally the gallstones can also block the flow of digestive enzymes from the pancreas because both the bile ducts and pancreas ducts drain through the same small opening (called the Ampulla of Vater) which is held tight by a small circular muscle (called the Sphincter of Oddi). [See Figure 1 below]. This results in inflammation of the pancreas and is known as gallstone pancreatitis. Blockage of the bile ducts may cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. If the bile duct remains blocked bile is unable to drain properly, jaundice (yellow discoloration of the eyes and skin) can develop and an infection known as cholangitis may also occur.</p>

<h3>Risk Factors</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">Who is at risk for gallstones?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Female gender, older age, obesity, high blood cholesterol levels, treatment with estrogen containing medications, rapid weight loss, diabetes and pregnancy are all risk factors for developing cholesterol gallstones. Disorders that lead to the destruction of red blood cells such as sickle cell anemia are associated with the development of pigmented or bilirubin stones. The occurrence of gallstones varies widely among different ethnic groups. For example, Pima Indians and Hispanics have high occurrence rates of developing gallstones compared to Asians, who overall, have a very low rate.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of gallstones?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Gallstones that are not causing symptoms generally do not require further evaluation. Many times gallstones are found by chance on an abdominal x-ray or ultrasound done for other reasons. Unless symptoms of pain, nausea, vomiting or fever are present, no additional testing or intervention may be needed. Symptoms arise when a gallstone blocks the flow of bile out of the gallbladder or through the bile ducts. A gallstone in the common bile duct is called choledocholithiasis and may cause intermittent or constant discomfort. The pain of choledocholithiasis is usually localized in the upper abdomen, and can radiate (be felt in another location) in the right shoulder, may last from 30 minutes to hours, and be associated with sweating, nausea, vomiting, and. Gallstone attacks can produce chest pain that may feel like a heart attack. If a pain is new and different than other pains the symptoms should be discussed with a physician.</p>
<p>An inflamed gallbladder (cholecystitis), infected material trapped within the common bile duct (cholangitis), or a stone blocking outflow of pancreatic juice (gallstone pancreatitis) can result in fever, chills, severe abdominal pain or jaundice. Individuals with these complaints should have an urgent evaluation by a physician.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">How are gallstones diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The diagnosis of gallstones is suspected when symptoms of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting occur. The location, duration and âcharacterâ (stabbing, gnawing, cramping) of the pain help to determine the likelihood of gallstone disease. Abdominal tenderness and abnormally high liver function blood tests may be present. An abdominal ultrasound examination is a quick, sensitive, and relatively inexpensive method of detecting gallstones in the gallbladder or common bile duct. This is the test most often used.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">What is the treatment for gallstones?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The treatment for gallstones that obstruct the common bile duct is endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or surgery. ERCP involves passage of a thin flexible scope through the mouth and into the duodenum where it is used to evaluate the common bile duct or pancreatic duct. Tiny tubes and instruments may be used to further evaluate the ducts and remove stones if necessary. Gallbladder surgery may be performed if there are stones found in the gallbladder itself, as these cannot be removed by ERCP. This operation, known as cholecystectomy, is frequently done using a laparoscope and is inserted into the abdomen through several small incisions under general anesthesia. If a gallbladder operation is not possible, a medicine known as ursodiol, may be used to dissolve cholesterol gallstones but this can take months, and the stones recur in many people once the treatment is stopped.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">What is gallstone pancreatitis?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Gallstone pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas that results from blockage of the pancreas duct by a gallstone. This occurs at the level of the sphincter of Oddi, a round muscle located at the opening of the bile duct into the small intestine. If a stone from the gallbladder travels down the common bile duct and becomes stuck at the sphincter, it blocks outflow of all material from the liver and pancreas. This results in inflammation of the pancreas that can be quite severe. Gallstone pancreatitis can be a life-threatening disease and evaluation by a physician urgently is needed if someone with gallstones suddenly develops severe abdominal pain.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risk Factors and Causes</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">Who gets gallstone pancreatitis?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Risk factors for gallstone pancreatitis are similar to those described for gallstone disease.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of gallstone pancreatitis?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Symptoms may be similar to those discussed above in <strong>Gallstones and Gallstone Disease</strong>. Additionally, the pain may be felt in the left upper abdomen or in the back. It is usually sudden in onset, quite severe, frequently sharp or squeezing in character, and often associated with nausea and vomiting.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">How is gallstone pancreatitis diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Blood tests can identify inflammation of the pancreas (amylase and lipase) and evidence of obstructed outflow of bile from the liver (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin). Inflammation of the pancreas is best demonstrated by an abdominal CAT scan, which can also determine the severity of the pancreatic inflammation. CT scans are not as sensitive at identifying small gallstones and an abdominal ultrasound may be ordered if this is considered the cause of the pancreatitis.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">What is the treatment of gallstone pancreatitis?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Pancreatitis is best treated initially by avoiding any intake of liquids and solids until the inflammation subsides. Intravenous delivery of fluids is usually all that is required if the inflammation is modest and symptoms resolve in a few days. Persistent pain or fevers suggest severe pancreatitis and ongoing inflammation. Intravenous delivery of nutrients should be started if oral intake cannot be resumed within approximately 5-7 days. Severe nausea and vomiting are treated initially by relieving the stomach of fluid by use of a nasogastric tube and with antinausea medications. Pain therapies may be administered by intravenous until oral treatments and food intake can resume. Sometimes it is important to remove a gallstone causing pancreatitis urgently, and other times it may be appropriate to wait 24-48 hours with regular assessments to assure the patient remains stable. Stones that cause gallstone pancreatitis may pass out of the duct without intervention or may require endoscopic or surgical removal. In cases of infected pancreatic tissue, or a condition called pancreatic necrosis (dead tissue) occurs, antibiotics may be used to control or prevent infection.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">What is sphincter of Oddi dysfunction?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction (SOD) is a symptom complex of intermittent upper abdominal pain that may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. This disorder is not completely understood. It is thought to be caused by either scarring or spasm of the sphincter of Oddi muscle. The sphincter of Oddi muscle is a small circular muscle approximately Â½ inch in length, located at the downstream end of the bile duct and pancreas duct. The function of this muscle is to keep the bile duct and pancreatic duct muscles closed and, therefore, prevent reflux of intestinal contents into the bile duct and pancreas duct. If this muscle should spasm or scar, drainage of the bile duct and/or pancreas duct may be hindered. Abnormal dilation of the bile duct and/or pancreas duct is often associated with an increase in the products and enzymes made by the liver, gallbladder and pancreas, which can be tested for with blood tests (serum liver tests, amylase, lipase). If the ducts are blocked this may result in pain.</p>

<h3>Risk Factors and Causes</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">Who gets SOD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Biliary dyskinesia may develop after the gallbladder has been removed, hence the name <strong>post-cholecystectomy syndrome</strong>.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of SOD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Symptoms may be similar to those for which the gallbladder was initially removed and include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. The symptoms may be episodic. They may wax and wane. Subjects may experience weight loss due to poor appetite. Fever, chills and diarrhea are not characteristic of this disease. If symptoms are severe and do not respond to conservative treatment, further investigation may be warranted.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">What establishes a diagnosis of SOD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>It is important to verify that other, more serious conditions are not being missed prior to embarking on a diagnosis of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Therefore, it would be important to verify that the patient does not have stones within the bile ducts, cancer of the pancreas or bile ducts, peptic ulcer disease or heart disease (poor blood flow to the heart, called âischemiaâ or âanginaâ may mimic these symptoms).</p>
<p>The diagnosis of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction can be confirmed using a special endoscope that allows the placement of a catheter into the bile and pancreatic ducts. Injection of contrast through the catheter coupled with the use of X-rays can give the physician pictures of the bile and pancreatic ducts. The procedure, which requires a special scope is known as an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This procedure can help determine the presence of gallstones in the gall bladder or bile duct. In the case of bile duct stones, special instruments and procedures (sphincterotomy with stone extraction) (see figure 2, above) can be used at the time of ERCP to remove the vast majority of them. Measurements of the contracting force of the sphincter of Oddi muscle can be made using a special plastic tube inserted into the bile duct or pancreas duct at the level of the sphincter of Oddi muscle. This is called âsphincter of Oddi manometryâ and is used to determine if the muscle is âdyskineticâ or contracts abnormally. If it does, a diagnosis of biliary dyskinesia is confirmed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/biliary-tract-disorders-gallbladder-disorders-and-gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">What is the treatment of SOD?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>In patients with severe symptoms that cannot be tolerated, the sphincter muscle may be cut open using the ERCP scope and a special plastic tube with a small wire attached to the side (called a âsphincterotomeâ). The sphincterotome is passed through the ERCP scope channel, then into the bile duct and/or pancreas duct at the level of the sphincter muscle. A small electric current is then applied to the wire, which then cuts and cauterizes the open muscle. This is called âsphincterotomyâ. This procedure should only be done by highly experienced doctors and only when symptoms are severe and do not resolve. Approximately 5-15% of patients who undergo this therapy may develop inflammation of the pancreas (called âpancreatitisâ) as a complication immediately following this procedure.</p>

<li><strong>Ultrasound</strong> â This test uses sound waves to examine the bile ducts, liver and pancreas. It is not invasive and is very safe. Stones may be seen in the gallbladder or bile ducts. Imaging may be impaired in patients who are obese or have recently eaten food. </li>
<li><strong>Endoscopic Ultrasound</strong> â This device uses a special scope with an ultrasound probe on the end. The scope is passed down into the small intestines where internal ultrasound images of the bile ducts, gallbladder and pancreas can be obtained. Use of the endoscopic ultrasound device requires special training. It is helpful in locating bile duct stones that may be missed by ordinary ultrasound. It is also helpful in diagnosing cancers within the pancreas and bile ducts.</li>
<li><strong>CT Scan</strong> â It is helpful in diagnosing cancers within the liver and pancreas. It may identify gallstones but is not as effective in finding them as ultrasound. It is the one of the best tests to assess the severity of pancreatitis.</li>
<li><strong>ERCP</strong> â ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography). This is a special type of endoscope, which allows access to the bile ducts and pancreas ducts. It also allows therapy to be performed such as removing stones from the bile ducts or pancreas ducts. Measurement of pressure within the sphincter of Oddi muscle may be performed at the time of ERCP by an additional test called sphincter of Oddi manometry (see section on Biliary Dyskinesia), which is a specialized test performed by a physician who has had additional training in this area.</li>
<li><strong>MRCP</strong> - (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography). This test uses a machine called MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). It is a noninvasive test that employs special computer software to create images of the bile and pancreatic ducts similar to the images obtained by ERCP and does not require an endoscopy. Abnormalities found on MRCP can be further evaluated or treated by ERCP or surgery.</li>

It is called  "small" because it is thin or narrow compared with the  "large" bowel (also known as the colon), but it is much longer than  the large bowel (14 feet on average). The small intestine is involved in  nutrient absorption from food.</p>

<p>GI bleeding occurs when an abnormality  on the inner lining begins to bleed. Approximately 5% of all GI bleeding comes  from the small bowel. Abnormal blood vessels (arteriovenous malformations or AVMs)  cause 30 to 40% of bleeds. AVMs are the main source of bleeding in patients  over the age of 50 years. Tumors (benign and malignant), polyps, Crohnâs  disease, and ulcers are some of the other causes of bleeding. </p>
<p>Multiple tests can be  used to diagnose and treat the source of small bowel bleeding, including:  endoscopy, enteroscopy, x-ray studies, capsule endoscopy, deep small bowel  enteroscopy, and intraoperative enteroscopy. AVMs can typically be treated with  cautery delivered through an endoscope or enteroscope. Tumors (benign and  malignant) can be biopsied and have their location marked using endoscopy, but  surgery is typically required to take them out. Other conditions, such as Crohnâs  disease, are often treated with medications.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[  <p>The causes of bleeding in the small  bowel are different from those in the colon or the stomach. The most common causes  of bleeding from the colon are polyps, diverticulosis (small out-pouchings in  the wall of the colon), or cancer. Upper GI (esophagus, stomach, or duodenum)  bleeding is most often due to ulcers. </p>
In the small bowel,  30 to 40% of bleeding is caused by abnormal blood vessels in the wall of the  small bowel. These abnormal blood vessels have many names, including  angioectasias, angiodysplasias, or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In  people over the age of 50 years, AVMs are the most common cause of small bowel  bleeding. Other causes of small bowel bleeding include benign (non-cancerous)  and malignant (cancerous) tumors, polyps, Crohn's disease (a type of  inflammatory bowel disease), and ulcers.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>There are multiple tests for evaluating  the small bowel. In most cases, the first step is endoscopy and/or enteroscopy.  If that fails to find the source of bleeding, a common next step is capsule  endoscopy. X-ray options include a small bowel follow-through or a computed  tomographic scan (also known as a CT or CAT scan) of the small bowel. Deep  small bowel enteroscopy can now be preformed using special scopes with  inflatable balloons and/or overtubes. The final option is intraoperative  enteroscopy. Intraoperative enteroscopy requires surgery and is usually only  done if the other tests are negative. All of these methods are discussed in  detail below.</p>
<h3>Endoscopy and enteroscopy</h3>
<p>Endoscopes and enteroscopes are  instruments used by doctors to evaluate the stomach and small bowel. Endoscopy  refers to the examination of the bowel using a scope. At times the term is used  specifically to indicate a procedure using a standard upper endoscope, but it  can also be used more broadly to include tests done with any type of scope. Endoscopes  and enteroscopes resemble long, thin tubes with a light and a camera at one  end. The images obtained are displayed on a monitor. The scopes have channels that  allow special equipment to be passed down them. This equipment can be used to  treat whatever is bleeding, to take biopsies, or to mark the location of a problem  with a tattoo to aid a surgeon in locating it later.</p>
<p>The test begins with the patient  receiving medications to make him or her sleepy. The doctor then passes the  scope through the mouth. A regular endoscope is capable of examining the  esophagus, stomach, and the first portion of the small bowel, known as the  duodenum. In cases where the source of bleeding is thought to be lower down in  the small bowel, a longer scope, known as an enteroscope, can be used. This  scope is capable of reaching the middle portion of the small bowel, known as  the jejunum. </p>
<h3>X-ray studies</h3>
<p>X-ray studies are sometimes used in  people with bleeding because 20-25% of small bowel bleeding is caused by  abnormalities in the intestinal wall that can be seen by standard or  specialized x-ray studies, such as tumors. There are three x-ray tests commonly  used in the evaluation of the small bowel â small bowel follow-through,  enteroclysis, and CT enterography. </p>
<p>The small bowel follow-through test is  a series of abdominal x-rays that are taken at different times after a patient  drinks a white, chalky fluid called barium that shows up on x-rays. The test  allows the doctor to examine the lining of the intestine for any  irregularities. The test is good for large abnormalities, but can miss many  smaller ones. However, it is safe and easy to tolerate.</p>
<p>A second x-ray test, the enteroclysis  study, is similar to the small bowel follow-through in that it uses barium to  visualize the inner wall of the small bowel. It is more invasive because it  requires a small tube called a catheter to be slowly advanced from the nose  down the esophagus, through the stomach, and into the small bowel, to allow for  air and barium to be instilled. The advantage of this study is that pictures  from enteroclysis have better resolution, so abnormalities missed by the small  bowel follow-through test may be detected. A disadvantage of the enteroclysis  study is that it can be an uncomfortable examination due to the presence of the  catheter and the use of air to distend the small bowel while taking pictures. In  some cases a CT scan is used instead of regular x-rays. This allows for even  more detail to be seen. </p>
<p>A third test is known as a CT  enterography. A CT  enterography is done the same way a normal CT scan is done. The patient drinks  an oral contrast solution (often dilute barium), while also receiving  intravenous (IV) contrast. Then numerous, very detailed images are obtained. A CT enterography  differs from a standard CT scan in that the type of contrast that the patient  drinks is designed to allow for a more detailed inspection of the lining of the  small bowel.</p>
<p>While none of these tests is perfect at  finding abnormalities, the advantage of these tests is that they can sometimes  find bleeding sources that are out of reach of a standard enteroscope. The  major limitations of these studies are that they cannot detect AVMs, and if an  abnormality is seen, there is no way to apply immediate treatment to stop the  bleeding, to take biopsies to confirm a diagnosis, or to mark the location of  the lesion with a tattoo. In addition, some patients are allergic to the IV  contrast that is used as part of the CT scan. </p>
<h3>Capsule endoscopy</h3>
  <p>Capsule endoscopy uses a device that is  about the size of a large pill. It is 1-1/8 inches long and 3/8 inches wide (26  mm x 11 mm). It is made up of a battery with an 8-hour lifespan, a strong light  source, a camera, and a small transmitter. Once swallowed, the capsule begins  transmitting images of the inside of the esophagus, stomach, and small bowel to  a receiver worn by the patient. The capsule takes two pictures per second, for  a total of about 55,000 images. After 8 hours, the patient returns the receiver  to the doctor who downloads the information to a computer and then can review  in detail the 8 hours of pictures of the capsule passing through the intestine.  The patient passes the capsule through the colon and it is eliminated in the  stool and discarded. </p>
<p>The capsule is generally safe and easy  to take; however, rarely the capsule can get stuck in the small intestine. This  may happen if there has been prior abdominal surgery causing scarring or other  conditions that cause narrowing of the small intestine. If the capsule becomes  stuck, endoscopic or surgical removal is necessary. However, if the capsule  becomes stuck, there is a good chance that it is stuck at the place where the  bleeding is coming from. So the procedure to get the capsule (endoscopy or  surgery) may be able to treat the bleeding site at the same time. In about 15%  of exams, the capsule does not view the entire small bowel prior to the battery  running out and may need to be repeated.</p>
<p>Like x-rays, the capsule cannot be used  to take biopsies, apply therapy, or mark abnormalities for surgery. Moreover,  the capsule cannot be controlled once it has been swallowed, so once it has passed  a suspicious area, it cannot be slowed to better look at the area. Despite  these limitations, capsule endoscopy is frequently the test of choice for  finding a source of small bowel bleeding if standard endoscopy has failed to do  so because it is able to look at the whole small bowel and is an easy test for  most people to do.</p>
<p>Overall, in patients with occult  bleeding (blood is microscopically present in the stool, but the stool looks  normal), capsule endoscopy finds a cause of bleeding in up to 67% of patients. In  cases of overt bleeding (blood is seen in the stool or the stool is black and  tarry), the results are highly variable. If the bleed happened in the past, the  yield may be as low as 6%. If, however, the doctor believes that there is  active bleeding occurring at the time of the test, the yield is &gt;90%.</p>
<h3>Deep small bowel enteroscopy</h3>
  <p>In cases where a lesion has been found  deep in the small bowel, beyond the reach of standard endoscopy, evaluation of  the deep small bowel may be needed. One option to further evaluate or to treat  the lesion is known as double balloon enteroscopy. Double balloon enteroscopy  uses two balloons attached to the scope to help the scope move through the  small bowel. Double balloon enteroscopy is able to reach very far into the  small bowel (in some cases as far as the ileum, which is the final segment of  the small bowel). This scope can also be inserted through the anus, which  allows for examination of the deepest parts of the small bowel (the scope must  first pass through the colon). In some cases, by doing the test through both  the mouth and through the anus, it is possible to examine the entire length of  the small bowel, though this is not always possible. </p>
<p>A double balloon enteroscopy test often  takes a couple of hours to perform, as opposed to 20 minutes for standard  endoscopy. Because an examination using a double balloon enteroscope is much  more involved than standard endoscopy, it is usually only used if a bleeding  site is found on either an x-ray or capsule endoscopy and is out of reach of a  standard enteroscope. In one study, double balloon enteroscopy was able to  locate a bleeding source in 74% of patients. </p>
<p>Because the test is done with an  enteroscope, if a source of bleeding is found it may be possible to treat it, take  biopsies, or mark the area with a tattoo. If a source is found, it can be  treated in about 60 to 70 percent of people.</p>
<p>In addition to double balloon  enteroscopy, there are two other options for deep small bowel enteroscopy. One  is single balloon enteroscopy, which is a test similar to double balloon  enteroscopy, though in this case there is only one balloon attached to the  scope. A second option is deep small bowel enteroscopy using a special spiral  tube that fits over the scope and allows the endoscope to be advanced into the  deep small bowel. </p>
<h3>Intraoperative enteroscopy</h3>
<p>In some cases, surgery  may be needed. Intraoperative enteroscopy is carried out in the operating room  under general anesthesia. The surgeon, often working with a gastroenterologist  (a doctor who specializes in the GI tract), inserts the endoscope through the  patientâs mouth or through a small incision in the small bowel (an enterotomy).  The surgeon then advances the endoscope through the intestine to examine the  entire small bowel. The advantage of intraoperative enteroscopy is that it  allows the doctor to treat the cause of bleeding if it is found (for AVMs), or  to remove masses or polyps. Because it is an invasive, surgical procedure,  however, intraoperative enteroscopy is usually only used when other methods  have failed to find or treat the source of bleeding. Overall, it is effective  in treating the source of bleeding in approximately 70% of the patients who  require the procedure.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[  <p>In cases of AVMs, a small amount of  electric current can be delivered through the endoscope to cauterize the  abnormality. If the AVM is discovered during endoscopy, the treatment can be done  immediately without requiring further endoscopy. If the bleeding source is  found by capsule endoscopy, treatment options include endoscopy, standard  enteroscopy, deep enteroscopy, or intraoperative enteroscopy (depending on the  location of the bleeding site and prior attempts at treating it). In rare cases  when there are a lot of AVMs in a segment of small bowel, the segment of small  bowel may need to be removed surgically. </p>
<p>Polyps can often be removed with an  endoscope. Sometimes surgery is needed if the polyp cannot be removed with an  endoscope. Tumors, both benign and malignant, typically require surgical removal  (while benign tumors do not always need to be removed, if they are causing a  lot blood loss they usually need to be taken out). Other causes of small bowel  bleeding can be treated with medicines (e.g., Crohn's disease or medication  induced ulcers).</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/celiac-disease/" class="faqquestion">What is Celiac Disease (CD)?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic (long-term) digestive disease during which patients have irritation (inflammation) of the small intestine, which causes difficulty with absorbing nutrients from food. Patients with CD often have other family members with the condition and are therefore susceptible to this disease. Inflammation in the intestine occurs when a patient with CD begins to eat food that contains gluten. Gluten is the name given to certain types of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye and related grains. Oats are currently considered not to be dangerous to persons with CD. However, due to the high possibility of contamination with other gluten containing grains, oats are typically not recommended for people with celiac disease.</p> 

<p>When food containing gluten arrives in the small intestine, the immune system reacts against the gluten, causing an inflammatory reaction in the wall of the intestine. The small intestine lining is covered by millions of villi (<strong>see figures 1&ndash;3</strong>), finger-like projections that act to increase the surface area of the intestine allowing increased absorption of nutrients. The villi are damaged by the inflammation in CD, which results in a decrease in the absorption of food. When gluten is removed from the diet, inflammation is reduced and the intestine begins to heal. The time when a patient develops symptoms varies from patient to patient after their first contact with the gluten protein. In many cases, it may be decades before symptoms and signs develop, often precipitated by a trigger.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/celiac-disease/" class="faqquestion">How common is Celiac Disease?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>In the U.S., approximately 1 out of every 100 people may have CD, though only 1 out of 5 people with celiac disease may be actually diagnosed and are aware that they have this disease. Some of these patients have mild forms of the disease and may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. There may be as many as 2&ndash;3 million people in the United States and 20 million in the world with CD.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/celiac-disease/" class="faqquestion">Who does Celiac Disease affect?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>CD affects many ethnicities, with the highest prevalence in Caucasians. Infants and children may have celiac disease, but CD is more commonly diagnosed in adulthood, and people can be diagnosed even in their seventies or eighties. Female patients are more likely to be diagnosed with celiac disease than male patients. Individuals that have type 1 diabetes, thyroid disorders, or relatives with CD are at greater risk for developing CD.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The symptoms or signs of celiac disease are highly variable. Some people have mild inflammation with few symptoms. Even though they may feel quite well, there is still damage occurring to the lining of the intestine. Other people have more severe inflammation, which causes symptoms that may be severe enough to lead them to visit their doctor. Occasionally, individuals will not have any symptoms at all even though their small intestine is severely inflamed.</p>

<p>Someone with celiac disease may have a variety of the above symptoms, and different people with celiac disease may have completely different symptoms. Celiac disease can mimic the symptoms of more common problems and be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is now recommended that patients with IBS symptoms such as abdominal pain and changes in bowel movements (especially diarrhea) be tested for celiac disease.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/celiac-disease/" class="faqquestion">How is Celiac Disease diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>It is important to remember that most patients with abdominal pain, bloating or diarrhea do not have celiac disease. In order to test for celiac disease with blood tests and/or endoscopy, the doctor should suspect celiac disease as the cause for the symptoms. When the doctor thinks that celiac disease is possible, but not very likely, then blood tests alone are done. If the blood tests are normal, other tests are rarely necessary. Sometimes the doctor strongly suspects that the symptoms are due to celiac disease or another similar illness, and will request an endoscopy and biopsy (sampling of the tissue of the small intestine). All tests for celiac disease, except for genetic tests, must be done while the patient is on a normal diet that contains gluten. Patients who are concerned that they may have celiac disease should not restrict their diet prior to seeking medical evaluation because this may cause false negative test results.</p> 

<p><strong>Blood tests:</strong><br>
Specific antibody blood tests are used to diagnose patients with CD. These blood tests are also used to test people who may be at risk for having CD but have no symptoms (relatives of patients with CD). The 2 most accurate tests used are the endomysial antibody and tissue transglutaminase antibody tests. Other tests, such as tests for deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies, may be used in restricted circumstances, but are not as accurate because they can be abnormal in healthy patients who do not have celiac disease or in people with other digestive problems. The original anti-gliadin or anti-gluten tests are no longer used for the diagnosis of celiac disease. Other tests for allergies will not detect celiac disease. Tests on saliva or stool for antibodies are not good substitutes for the blood-based tests. Genetic tests are available to assist doctors when the blood tests are unclear, or when patients continue to have symptoms while on a gluten free diet. However, simply carrying the genes that enable celiac disease does not mean that the patient will get celiac disease, only that it is possible. Not having the genes is a very good way to rule out the possibility of having celiac disease and may be used when the certainty of diagnosis is in doubt.</p> 

<p><strong>Endoscopy:</strong><br>
Establishing a firm diagnosis of CD requires taking biopsy samples of the small intestine using endoscopy. Endoscopy involves insertion of a thin flexible tube through the mouth into the stomach and small intestine. Tiny samples are taken from the wall of the small intestine and are examined under a microscope for changes of CD. This test is usually performed with the aid of sedatives.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/celiac-disease/" class="faqquestion">How is Celiac Disease treated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Celiac disease is treated by avoiding all foods that contain gluten. Gluten is what causes inflammation in the small intestine. When this is removed from the diet, the intestine will heal and return to normal. Dieticians with expertise in gluten-free diets are essential for educating patients and tailoring diets. Medications are not normally required to treat CD except in occasional patients who do not respond to a gluten-free diet. There are many CD support groups available for patients and family members.</p>

<p>Getting used to the gluten free diet requires some lifestyle changes. The key to understanding the gluten-free diet is to become a good ingredient label reader. If a food has questionable ingredients avoid it and find a similar product that you know is gluten-free.

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Patients with CD who do not adhere to the gluten-free diet usually continue to suffer from symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, gas and diarrhea. In addition, these patients are at higher risk for developing complications of CD such as cancer of the small intestine and esophagus, and narrowing in the intestine due to inflammation.</p>

<p>Other complications of CD that may be avoided by strictly following a gluten-free diet include fatigue, poor growth, decreased adult height, osteoporosis, bone pain, joint pain, difficulty having children, narrowing of the intestine, cancer of the esophagus (food tube) and small intestine, lymphoma (another type of cancer) and neuropathy (unsteady walking and confusion which may be severe). Patients may have deficiencies of certain vitamins (iron, vitamin B12, folate, zinc, copper, vitamin D and calcium. Usually it is a good idea to check for these deficiencies, especially in adults. Also, a test to determine the density of a personâs bones is routinely done, when an adult is diagnosed with celiac disease.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>It is important that the symptoms get better. If they do not, then the patient should contact their doctor. Follow-up every 1â2 years should include a blood test to follow the celiac activity. Patients with ongoing or recurrent symptoms need to be rescoped. Some specialists will rescope to make sure that healing has happened, even if the symptoms are gone.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colon-polyps/" class="faqquestion">What is a colon polyp?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>A colon polyp is a small growth on the inner lining of the large intestine, some of which can progress into cancer. Polyps may be scattered throughout the colon and vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. Polyps may have a flat or raised appearance. When raised they can resemble small bumps (called sessile), or even grow on short stalks (called pedunculated), resembling a mushroom or small cauliflower.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colon-polyps/" class="faqquestion">Why are colon polyps so important?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Colon polyps are important because of their known relationship to colon cancer, which is the third leading cancer in the US, and the second leading cause of cancer related death. It is well established that most colon cancers arise from colon polyps. By identifying and removing colon polyps during colonoscopy, we can prevent their progression to cancer and ultimately save lives.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colon-polyps/" class="faqquestion">Are all colon polyps cancerous?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>The vast majority of polyps are NOT cancerous or even pre-cancerous. The polyps without the potential to turn into cancer include small hyperplastic polyps, inflammatory polyps, and hamartomatous polyps which are not part of an inherited polyp syndrome. The precancerous polyp which can turn into a cancer is called an adenoma. The two most common types of colorectal polyps are hyperplastic polyps and adenomas. Usually, the larger the size of the adenoma, the greater the chance that there may be cancer or pre-cancerous cells present in the polyp. Since it is hard to determine the exact nature of a polyp, polyps found during colonoscopy are removed and sent to the lab for a microscopic analysis.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colon-polyps/" class="faqquestion">How long does it take a colon polyp to grow into a cancer?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Current theories propose it will take about 10 years for a small adenoma to transform into a cancer. That is why the standard interval for screening colonoscopy is 10 years. However, the time interval may be shorter for patients with a hereditary form of colon cancer (like familial adenomatous polyposis or hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer) or inflammatory bowel disease. The recommended intervals are general guidelines and may not apply to every patient.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p><em>Most polyps do not produce any symptoms, which is why screening is so important.</em> Rarely, a polyp may cause visible blood to appear in your stool. Sometimes blood will only be detected with special testing your doctor may perform on a stool sample (hemoccult testing). Rarely, polyps may cause a change in bowel habits; if the polyp or cancer is very large it may lead to constipation, or perhaps diarrhea, though this is highly unusual.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There appears to be a combination of environmental and hereditary factors that leads to forming polyps. Smoking, obesity, alcohol intake, eating a high fat diet, red meat consumption, and low fiber intake are all associated with the risk of polyp formation. The increased risk of colorectal polyps and cancer for smokers extends for at least 10 years after they discontinue smoking. There are also genetic changes that are associated with colon polyps and cancer.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<ul><li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colon-polyps/" class="faqquestion">Who should be checked for colon polyps?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Both men and women at average risk for colorectal cancer should begin screening for colon polyps at age 50. Recent evidence and guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology, recommend beginning at age 45 for African Americans as this ethnic group has demonstrated a higher risk for precancerous polyps as well as colon cancer. If you have a family history of colorectal polyps or cancer, or certain conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, you may require screening at an even earlier age or more frequent interval. There are rare hereditary colon cancer syndromes which run in families, where colonoscopy is recommended at a much younger age and repeated frequently.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colon-polyps/" class="faqquestion">What if my family member has colon polyps, does that mean I will also?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>When one first-degree relative (parent, sibling, child) has colon polyps or colon cancer diagnosed when they are younger than 60 years old, your risk of developing colon polyps is doubled compared to someone without an affected family member. Therefore, if your father, mother, brother or sister developed an advanced adenoma polyp or cancer before the age of 60, you should begin with cancer screening at age 40, or 10 years before their diagnosis, whichever is first. If you have two first-degree relatives with polyps or colon cancer, your risk is even higher. Your doctor will likely want to perform colonoscopy at a younger age and at more frequent intervals based on your personal family history.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<ul><li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colon-polyps/" class="faqquestion">What tests are available to check for polyps?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Because most polyps do NOT cause any symptoms, colorectal cancer screening for polyps is crucial for colorectal cancer prevention. There are many tests currently available to help diagnose colon polyps including special x-ray tests, such as barium enema, or computed tomography (CT) colonography (virtual colonoscopy). There is considerable concern at present with the radiation exposure with CT colonography and patients should ask their physicians about this if it is recommended. Barium enemas are no longer recommended as an acceptable screening option by the American College of Gastroenterology. Endoscopic tests such as flexible sigmoidoscopy, which is a limited examination of the lower colon, or colonoscopy are other alternatives. The "gold standard" test that is currently available is colonoscopy, as it is the only test that is able to evaluate the entire colon lining for polyps, as well as take tissue samples and remove any polyps during the same procedure. In addition, there are stool tests available that check for hidden blood or abnormal DNA which are currently available to help detect cancers of the colon, though it is important to realize they screen for cancer, not polyps.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colon-polyps/" class="faqquestion">What preparation is required before a colon exam?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>An oral colon cleansing prep is necessary before a colonoscopy, barium enema and CT colonography. Preparation for flexible sigmoidoscopy is typically limited to enemas. The ability to detect colon polyps and cancer is enhanced by an excellent bowel preparation and limited by the inadequacy of bowel cleansing. Therefore, it is very important you take the preparation according to your doctor's instructions. This will help prevent your doctor from not being able to see the lining of the colon well enough to detect polyps or cancer.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<ul><li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colon-polyps/" class="faqquestion">What is the treatment for colon polyps?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The best treatment for colon polyps is polypectomy (a painless removal of the polyp with a colonoscope at the time of colonoscopy). Sometimes a polyp is too large to remove completely in one session requiring either multiple colonoscopies, or rarely even surgery to remove it completely.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colon-polyps/" class="faqquestion">What follow-up will I need if I am diagnosed with colon polyps?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Follow-up depends on what type of polyp you have. Small hyperplastic polyps located in the lower colon typically do not require follow-up, and a repeat colonoscopy is recommended in 10 years as long as you do not have additional factors (personal or family history of polyps or colon cancer, etc.). Hyperplastic polyps in the upper colon may require more frequent follow up colonoscopy. Adenomatous polyps will require a repeat (surveillance) colonoscopy in an interval based on the size of the polyp, microscopic appearance and number of polyps you have. Individuals with a personal history of polyps are at increased risk for developing new polyps. It is important to remember that the quality of your bowel prep, as well as your family history, will also determine when you may require your repeat colonoscopy.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colon-polyps/" class="faqquestion">Will colon polyps recur after they have been removed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Polyps will not recur if they are completely removed. Once a person has an adenoma, the risk of recurrence of polyps is 30-40% at three years. Since individuals with polyps are more likely to develop new polyps, surveillance colonoscopy is recommended.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<ul><li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colon-polyps/" class="faqquestion">What can I do to prevent colon polyps?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>At the current time, no one knows how to prevent colon polyps. Following a healthy lifestyle, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol, limiting red meat consumption, incorporating plenty of vegetables, and calcium-rich foods into your diet, physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight may reduce your chance of polyp development. There are also some studies suggesting that a daily aspirin or even calcium supplement may also be protective. However, you should always consult with your physician if you are planning on taking an aspirin product, or increasing your calcium intake to be certain that there are no increased risks to your personal health.</p>
<p>Nothing will absolutely guarantee prevention of colon cancer but screening with colonoscopy is, by far the best bet! Talk to your health care provider about appropriate screening.</p>

Gas can contribute to a sense of  bloating (fullness), belching, abdominal cramps, and flatulence (gas). These  symptoms are usually brief and resolve once gas is released by belching or  flatulence. Some people can be more sensitive to even normal amounts of gas and  develop the above symptoms. </p>]]></wp:meta_value>

<p>Bloating refers to a sense of fullness in the upper abdomen. This can  be influenced by gas and/or food accumulation in the stomach. Some patients  experience the symptom with normal amounts of gastric gas. </p>
<p>Flatulence refers to the passage of rectal gas. The gas is generally a  combination of swallowed air and gas produced by the action of colon bacteria  on undigested carbohydrates. </p>
<p>Gas which accumulates in the right upper portion of the colon can lead  to pain which could seem like gallbladder pain. Gas which accumulates in the  left upper portion of the colon can radiate up to the chest and seem like  cardiac pain. </p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>We all swallow air during the process of eating.Â Individuals  can have excess swallowing due to sucking on hard candies or chewing gum.  Drinking carbonated beverages such as soda or beer can also generate excess  gastric air. In addition, individuals who experience anxiety may swallow air  excessively. Poorly fitting dentures and chronic postnasal âdripâ can also  cause excess air swallowing. As a result, significant amounts of gas can enter  the stomach and small bowel in 24 hours which can lead to belching, bloating or  flatulence.</p>
<p>Some carbohydrates cannot be digested by the enzymes in the small  intestine and reach the colon where bacteria metabolize them to hydrogen and  carbon dioxide gasses. Examples of such food are bran, cabbage, cauliflower,  broccoli, and beans. This can result in excess flatulence in some patients. Many  patients experience abdominal cramps, bloating and flatulence when they ingest  milk, certain cheeses or ice cream because they lack the enzyme (lactase) which  is required to digest milk sugars (lactose). This condition, called lactose  intolerance, is less common in people of northern European origin.</p>
<p>Another cause of  bloating and abdominal distension is termed bacterial overgrowth. This is not  an infection, but occurs when there is an excess amount of normal bacteria in  the small intestine. This results in increased production of intestinal gas  contributing to the above symptoms. Finally, underlying constipation may also  contribute to bloating and a sense of abdominal distention. </p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>As mentioned above, excessive air swallowing, and certain foods and  carbonated beverages are significant contributors to belching and flatulence. Some  patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) appear to be uniquely sensitive to  normal or only slightly increased volumes of intestinal gas and may develop  abdominal cramps as a result. Patients with altered anatomy due to surgery or  those with certain rheumatologic diseases may be at an increased risk of  bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine which can lead to belching,  bloating or flatulence.</p>
<p>Some patients, particularly women who have had one or more pregnancies,  experience abdominal distension when standing erect. This is often assumed to  be gas accumulation. However, if the distension is not present when the patient  is lying âflatâ, then the likely explanation is weak abdominal muscles (which  extend from the lower rib cage to the pelvis on both sides of the umbilicus)  due to the stretching and loss of muscle tone which occurs during pregnancy.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>There are individuals who have heartburn and stomach disorders that may  swallow air for relief. The diagnosis of esophageal reflux or gastric  inflammation should be excluded by x-rays or endoscopy (examining the esophagus  and stomach with a flexible tube while the patient is sedated). Abdominal distension when erect but not when  recumbent is an indication of weak abdominal muscles. If lactose intolerance is  suspected, milk can be withdrawn from the diet and symptoms observed. However,  lactose can be administered orally and the hydrogen gas which is generated in  susceptible people can be measured in the breath. Postnasal discharge from  sinus problems can cause air swallowing and should be considered. If bacterial  overgrowth is suspected, your physician may administer a hydrogen breath test. </p>
<p>Blood tests are not usually helpful for gaseous problems but testing  for celiac disease may prove useful since failure to absorb wheat, barley, and  rye can lead to excess flatulence.</p>
<p>Patients complaining of excessive gas passages may benefit from keeping  a âflatusâ diary for three days. The time of each gas passage and food for each  meal can be noted. The gas passages can be compared to published ânormalâ  flatus frequency.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Patients should eliminate carbonated beverages such as soda and beer. Foods  such as cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, beans, and bran should be avoided. Milk  and other dairy foods should be avoided. Lactaid milk or non-dairy milk such as  soy or almond milk can be used. Chewing gum and sucking on hard candies should  be avoided. Sugar free gum and hard candies should be avoided as they may have  mannitol or sorbitol as sweeteners which can cause flatulence. To ensure that  only potentially symptom causing foods are eliminated without resulting in  marked dietary restrictions, patients should eliminate food items one by one  and keep a symptom diary.</p>
<p>Simethicone products have been promoted as treatment for gaseousness  but their efficacy has not been convincing. Charcoal tablets have also been  used to reduce flatulence without convincing benefit. Bismuth subsalicylate has  been used to reduce the noxious odor of some sulfa-containing rectal gasses. Alpha-d-galactosidase,  an over the counter product, has been used to help in the digestion of complex  carbohydrates. Some patients may benefit from this strategy. </p>
<p>Individuals with IBS may benefit from symptomatic therapy for âgas  painsâ by using antispasmodic therapy such as dicyclomine or hyoscyamine under  the tongue.</p>
<p>Some patients with bacterial overgrowth may see improvement from the  occasional use of antibiotics to reduce the number of bacteria in the small  bowel, thereby reducing gas production.</p>
<p>If weak abdominal muscles are suspected as a cause for abdominal  distension, abdominal-tensing exercises may be helpful, although very difficult  to achieve when patients are middle aged and older.</p>
<p>Â If symptoms fail to respond to  the dietary strategies noted above, medical help should be sought to be  confident that no other underlying abnormalities are present.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT POINTS</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Belching and flatulence are normal body  processes.</li>
  <li>Swallowed air is âgasâ in the body and  contributes significantly to symptoms.</li>
  <li>Unabsorbed dietary carbohydrates can cause gas  production by colon bacteria.</li>
  <li>Carbonated beverages, sucking on hard candy, and  chewing gum should be avoided.</li>
  <li>Abdominal distension when erect but not  recumbent may be due to weak abdominal muscles.</li>
  <li>Increasing frequency or severity of symptoms  should prompt medical attention.</li>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Constipation is one of the most frequent gastrointestinal complaints in the USA and Western countries. There are at least 2.5 million doctor visits for constipation in the USA each year, and hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on laxatives yearly.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/constipation-and-defection-problems/" class="faqquestion">How is constipation defined?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Constipation is often thought of as a decrease in frequency of stools and many people believe they are constipated if they do not have a bowel movement each day. This is not correct, as many persons have as few as three bowel movements each week and are healthy. For many people, constipation means too much straining with bowel movements, passage of small hard stools or a sense that they have not completely emptied their bowels. The American College of Gastroenterology defines constipation based upon symptoms including unsatisfactory defecation with either infrequent stools, difficult stool passage or both.  Any recent change in bowel habits, if persistent, may be cause for concern. </p> </div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/constipation-and-defection-problems/" class="faqquestion">What causes constipation?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Constipation most commonly occurs when the waste (stool) that forms after food is digested moves too slowly (slow transit) as it passes through the digestive tract. Dehydration, changes in diet and activity, and certain drugs are frequently to blame to slow transit of stool. When stool moves slowly, too much water is absorbed from the stool, and it becomes hard and dry. Gradual enlargement of the rectum and poor coordination of the pelvic and anal muscles sometimes contribute to or cause constipation. Sometimes a combination of these processes occurs. Another cause, bowel obstruction (blockage), is serious but uncommon. </p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/constipation-and-defection-problems/" class="faqquestion">What kind of evaluation should constipated patients undergo?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>A doctor usually relies on the person's account of constipation when making a diagnosis. The doctor also examines the rectum with a gloved finger and, if stool is present, determines the amount and consistency. The stool is tested for occult (hidden) blood. The person's symptoms and an examination are often all that are needed to confirm a diagnosis of constipation and to determine the likely cause.</p>

<p>When the cause remains unclear, tests may be done. The doctor may recommend an examination with a flexible viewing tube, either of just the lower part of the large intestine (sigmoidoscopy) or of the entire large intestine (colonoscopy). This examination is important if the constipation developed suddenly or if it is worsening noticeably.</p>

<p>Occasionally, other tests are needed to determine the cause. An abdominal x-ray may show evidence of bowel obstruction or suggest another cause. Other tests measure transit through the colon over several days by swallowing capsules containing tiny rings that can be seen on x-rays or by swallowing a telemetry capsule. Rectal sensation and muscle coordination can be assessed by placing a thin catheter into the rectum (anorectal manometry). Finally, emptying of the rectum can be tested in the laboratory or with special x-rays (defecography).</p></div></li></ul>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/constipation-and-defection-problems/" class="faqquestion">What are the treatments for constipation?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>When stool is impacted, tap water enemas are commonly used. Usually people are positioned on their left side, with knees flexed. About 5 to 10 ounces of water, at body temperature, are gently instilled into the rectum and sigmoid colon. When the water is emptied, the impacted stool is passed with it. Non-prescription prepackaged enemas can be used in place of tap water. If enemas fail to work, a health care practitioner may need to remove the stool manually using a gloved finger. The person is then sometimes asked to drink a solution containing dissolved salts and polyethylene glycol, which cleanses the digestive tract.</p>

<p>After the impaction has been removed, the person may be told to add fiber to the diet or to use laxatives to prevent constipation. Laxatives may be used every two to three days if a bowel movement does not occur naturally.</p>

<p>If the stool is not impacted, several options are available for treating constipation. Increasing the intake of fluids and fiber is often the first step. Vegetables, fruit (especially prunes), whole-grain breads, and high-fiber cereals are excellent sources of fiber. Bran is an alternative source, although it may cause excessive gas and bloating. To work well, fiber should be consumed with plenty of fluids.</p>

<p>Laxatives and stool softeners are sometimes needed if changes in diet are insufficient. Most laxatives are safe for long-term uses, if used appropriately.</p>

<p>Bulking agents, such as psyllium and methylcellulose, are laxatives that help hold water in the stool and add bulk to it. The increased bulk stimulates the natural contractions of the large intestine. Bulkier stools are softer and easier to pass. Bulking agents act slowly and gently. These agents generally are taken in small amounts at first. The dose is increased gradually until regularity is achieved. </p>

<p>Osmotic agents are laxatives that keep large amounts of water in the large intestine, making the stool soft and loose. These laxatives consist of salts or sugars that are poorly absorbed. Some contain magnesium and phosphate, which can be partially absorbed resulting in harm to people with kidney failure.</p>

<p>Stimulant laxatives contain substances that directly stimulate the walls of the large intestine (such as senna and bisacodyl), causing them to contract. Taken by mouth, stimulant laxatives generally cause a bowel movement in six to eight hours. Some are available as suppositories. When taken as suppositories, these laxatives often work in 15 to 60 minutes. Stimulant laxatives are best used for brief periods. If longer use is needed, they may be used daily or every other day, and optimally under a doctor's supervision.</p>

<p>Newer medications, which increase secretion of fluids into the intestine, are available only by prescription. They should be considered if constipation does not respond well to over-the-counter laxatives. When constipation is due to opiate drugs used to treat severe pain, new agents that block the effects of opiates on the gut sometimes can help.  Occasionally, a problem with coordination of pelvic floor and anorectal muscles may be identified. This can be treated with biofeedback or muscle retraining exercises; such treatments are performed only in centers which specialize in this area and upon referral by a doctor.</p></div>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>A combination of an adequate intake of fluids, adequate exercise, and a high-fiber diet may prevent constipation. Laxatives are sometimes a helpful addition to these measures. For example, when a person needs to take a potentially constipating drug, a stimulant laxative along with increased intake of dietary fiber and fluids helps prevent constipation.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/crohns-disease/ â" class="faqquestion">What is Crohnâs Disease?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Crohnâs disease (CD) belongs to a group of diseases collectively called Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) which also includes Ulcerative Colitis (UC). It is a chronic disease that can cause inflammation anywhere from the mouth to the anus anywhere along the lining of the digestive tract. It most commonly affects the small intestine and the colon. The disease can show up along different parts of the digestive tract in a continuous or patchy distribution.  It typically involves both the superficial and deep layers of the intestinal wall.</p> </div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/crohns-disease/ â" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of CD?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Symptoms of CD depend on the severity and location of the intestinal inflammation and can range from none or mild, to severe.  Symptoms may develop gradually or come on suddenly, without warning.  Abdominal pain and cramping, persistent diarrhea (loose, watery, numerous bowel movements), blood in the stool and fever are hallmark symptoms of CD. Ulcers of the mouth, a lack of appetite, fatigue, nausea and vomiting and unexplained weight loss may also develop. With severe diarrhea and the digestive tracksâ inability to absorb nutrients, nutritional deficiencies may occur over time.</p> </div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/crohns-disease/ â" class="faqquestion">What causes CD?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>We do not yet know an exact cause of CD. Similar to other chronic inflammatory disorders (e.g. asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis) there is a complex interaction between an individualâs genetic make-up, their immune system and foreign substances in the environment (including dietary factors and microbes living in our gut) that are responsible for the chronic uncontrolled inflammation in CD.  The impact of the various factors (genes, immune system and environment) are different for each individual accounting for the broad spectrum of how patients present with inflammation in different segments of the intestine and in various degrees of severity. Unfortunately, it appears as if once this inflammatory process is set in motion it cannot be regulated or reversed by the body itself. </p> </div>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/crohns-disease/ â" class="faqquestion">Who gets CD and how common is it?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>CD affects about 500,000 Americans. Men and women appear to be affected equally. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 15-35 but can develop at any time during oneâs lifetime. It used to be thought that CD predominantly affects Caucasians in North America and Western Europe, however, we now see individuals being diagnosed with CD in populations from South America, Africa and Asia where the disease was unheard of 20 years ago. </p>

<p>CD can run in families and having a sibling or another first degree relative afflicted with the disease can increase the risk of developing the disease by ten to fifteen times as compared to the general population. Some important genetic mutations have been identified in this disease including the NOD2/CARD 15 genes. However, more than 80% of patients with CD do not have a recognized genetic disposition. Given the complex genetic makeup the disease it is not inherited in the classic sense.</p>

<p>Smoking is an important controllable risk factor in CD. People who smoke with this disease tend to have more severe forms of the disease and are at higher risk of needing surgery. People who live in industrialized countries and urban areas are also at elevated risk of having the disease. Some other factors including the use of medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin-like drugs) and particular infections have been theorized to exacerbate or cause the disease although none have been shown in a consistent fashion to be the cause.</p> </div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/crohns-disease/ â" class="faqquestion">How is CD diagnosed?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>There is no single test to confirm the diagnosis of CD. Instead, multiple tests are usually used in combination to help arrive at the diagnosis depending on the symptoms that lead individuals to seek care.  Ultimately, a colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy must be performed to directly visualize the intestine internally and to obtain small tissue samples (biopsies) for evaluation under the microscope. Other imagines studies can be used in conjunction with a colonoscopy to help in the evaluation including a barium enema, upper gastrointestinal series (UGI series) with small bowel follow through, computerized tomography scans (CT scans or âcat scansâ), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a pill camera study (capsule endoscopy) but are not mandated.  Blood tests which look for antibodies and markers of inflammation along with stool specimen tests for hidden blood and infection may also be used to help confirm or exclude the diagnosis of CD.</p> </div>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/crohns-disease/ â" class="faqquestion">What are different types of treatment for CD?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Currently, there is no cure for CD and the goal of treatment is to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and improve quality of life. This can be achieved through suppression of the bodyâs immune response which is paramount to allow the intestinal tissue to heal and retain its normal function.  Initially, the goal is to induce remission, which is to bring the symptoms under control.  Once this step is achieved, medical therapy is used to maintain remission with the goal of decreasing the frequency of disease flares.Â Several groups of drugs are used to treat Crohnâs disease and are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Aminosalicylates (5-ASA)</strong>: This class of anti-inflammatory drugs is often used to treat mild to moderate symptoms in the colon and includes oral formulations of sulfasalazine and mesalamine (AprisoÂ®, AsacolÂ®, ColazalÂ®, DipentumÂ®, PentasaÂ®, orÂ LialdaÂ®) and drugs that may be administered rectally (CanasaÂ® or RowasaÂ®). </li>

<li><strong>Corticosteroids</strong>: This class of medications has a general, nonspecific effect of suppressing the entire immune system and is used to treat moderate to severe forms of the disease. Prednisone, budesonide and methylprednisolone are most commonly used. These are drugs that are best utilized short-term to alleviate major flares of the disease and due to side effects, these should not be used for maintenance therapy. Owing to a significantly increased risk of osteoporosis with the use of corticosteroids, a baseline DEXA scan should be performed at the initiation of therapy. Supplementation of calcium and vitamin D, and consideration of a bisphosphonate are also warranted. </li>

<li><strong>Immune modifiers</strong>: Azathioprine (ImuranÂ®), 6-MP (PurinetholÂ®), cyclosporine A and methotrexate alter the immune system and are also referred to as immunomodulators,Â used to help decrease exposure to corticosteroids, maintain disease remission and to help heal fistulas.</li>

<li><strong>Antibiotics</strong>: These are classically used to treat perianal disease, abscesses and sometimes acute flares of the disease. Metronidazole and ciprofloxacin are the most commonly used.</li>

<li><strong>Biologic therapies</strong>: This newer group of medications was first approved in 1998 for moderate to severe CD that did not respond to conventional therapy or to treat fistulae. These medications work by blocking specific chemical messages between immune cells.  Infliximab (RemicadeÂ®) was the first biologic therapyÂ to treat inflammatory bowel disease andÂ since 2007, adalimumab (HumiraÂ®), Natalizumab (TysabriÂ®) and Certolizumab pegol (CimziaÂ®) have all been approved by the FDA to treat patients with CD. These medications primarily differ in their composition and schedule of administration. They are all given through infusion or injection therapy.  These medications are more costly than conventional agents and also suppress the immune system leading to a small, but significant increased risk of infections and, rarely, to lymphomas. </li></div>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/crohns-disease/ â" class="faqquestion">Is there a role for surgery in CD?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Surgery does not cure CD but is currently required at some point in the course of a majority of patients (up to 80%) with CD over their lifetime.  Common indications for surgery include presence of an intestinal obstruction, formation of an abscess or fistula.  Surgery also becomes necessary in CD when medications can no longer control the symptoms.  Usually, the severely affected part of the intestine is removed and the two ends are reconnected. If there is extensive disease of the colon in CD, the entire colon may be removed and an end-ileostomy (end of the small intestine attached to the skin with an external bag to collect the contents) may be performed.  The overall goal of surgery in CD is to conserve bowel and maintain the best possible quality of life. Most patients who require surgery will have marked improvements in their symptoms, reduction in their medications and an improvement in their quality of life. </p> </div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/crohns-disease/ â" class="faqquestion">What complications should I watch out for in CD?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p><strong>CD may cause symptoms outside the digestive tract</strong> including: inflammation of the eye (conjunctivitis, episcleritis, uveitis, iritis), inflammation of joints (arthritis), weakening of bones (osteoporosis), skin rashes (erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum), inflammation of the liver or bile ducts (primary sclerosing cholangitis), kidney stones, gallstones and in children, delayed growth or sexual development due to the use of steroids, malnutrition and malabsorption.</p>

<p>Crohnâs disease may also lead to several complications over time which may be related to the disease or due to the effects of medications used to treat the disease. Listed below are some of the common complications: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Anal fissure. </strong> A crack, or cleft, in or around the skin of the anus which lead to painful bowel movements, blood in the stool and sometimes drainage around the anal canal.</li>

<li><strong>Ulcers.</strong>  Chronic inflammation can lead to open sores (ulcers) anywhere in the digestive tract, including the mouth, genital area (perineum) and anus. </li>

<li><strong>Fistulas.</strong>  Sometimes ulcers can extend completely through the intestinal wall, creating a fistula â an abnormal tunnel between different parts of the intestine, between the intestine and skin or other organs, such as the bladder or vagina. These abnormal connections affect up to a third of patients with CD. Internal connections lead to diversion of food contents while external connections can lead to drainage and infections.  When a course of medical therapy fails, surgery may be necessary to fix these abnormal connections.  </li>

<li><strong>Bowel obstruction.</strong>  Due to inflammation over time, parts of the bowel could form scar tissue resulting in a thickening and narrowing of the bowel, which may block the flow of digestive contents through the affected part of the intestine. Medications may be of help in decreasing the inflammation and opening up the narrowed areas but some cases require surgery to remove the diseased portion of the bowel. </li>

<li><strong>Malnutrition.</strong>  Symptoms of diarrhea, pain and cramping may make it difficult to eat. In addition, inflammation of the intestine can decrease absorption of vital nutrients needed to maintain nourishment.  Deficiencies of proteins, calories and vitamins may occur over a prolonged period of time. Vitamin B-12 and iron deficiency frequently lead to anemia in patients with malnutrition.</li>

<li><strong>Colon cancer.</strong> Patients with Crohnâs disease that involves the colon do have an increased risk of colon cancer depending upon the amount of the colon that is affected and the duration of disease.   Less than 5% of patients develop colon cancer although this is higher than the general population.  Therefore, after approximately 8 years from the start of symptoms a colonoscopy is performed every 1 to 2 years to look for precancerous changes called dysplasia.  Identifying dysplasia allows the potential to remove dysplastic growths (polyps) prior to the development of cancer.</li> </div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/crohns-disease/ â" class="faqquestion">What is the clinical course and prognosis in CD?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Most people with CD with the proper medical care tend to live healthy, productive lives with a normal life span. Maintenance of remission and surveillance for complications are the major goals which lead to maintaining quality of life in patients with CD.  Regular visits with a gastroenterologist and developing a longstanding relationship are vital to managing this disease.</p> </div>
</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/crohns-disease/ â" class="faqquestion">Can women with CD have children?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>A healthy pregnancy, childbirth and baby are possible in women with CD.  Well controlled CD does not increase the risk of miscarriages, stillbirths or congenital abnormalities. The goal during pregnancy is to prevent and treat flares aggressively to decrease any increased risk to the fetus during a flare.</p> </div>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/crohns-disease/ â" class="faqquestion">What can I do to improve my health in CD?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Diet, nutrition, stress and lifestyle modifications can all lead to improved quality of life in patients with CD.  Unfortunately, there is no single diet that is appropriate for all patients with CD and dietary advice will depend upon the location of intestinal inflammation and the associated symptoms. There is no factor in the diet that we know causes inflammation, but dietary components can certainly cause or worsen symptoms. Healthy diets (avoiding fatty and fried foods), and adequate intake of protein improve symptoms and maintain nutrition. Some patients will not tolerate milk products (containing the milk sugar â lactose) or other concentrated sugars such as fructose (corn syrup). Taking multivitamins and speaking to a dietician also can be of great benefit. Exercise and stress management can decrease flares and help moderate the disease. Smoking should be stopped by all who have CD or are at increased risk of developing CD. A group of medications, known as NSAIDS (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen), should also be avoided as they can worsen CD in some patients.</p> </div>
</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/crohns-disease/ â" class="faqquestion">What are the chances my child will have CD if I do?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Children who have one parent with CD have approximately a 7-10% lifetime risk of developing this disease. If both parents have the disease then the lifetime risk increases to 35%.</p> </div>
</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/crohns-disease/ â" class="faqquestion">Do complementary and alternative therapies work in CD?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Many alternative therapies have been tried in CD due to either the lack of effectiveness of primary medical therapies or side effects of common therapies. Acupuncture, hypnosis, herbal supplements, fish oil, probiotics and other home remedies have been reported. Unfortunately, most of these remedies have shown no significant benefit, have never been rigorously studied and are not regulated by the FDA.</p> </div>

Worldwide, it is a leading cause of  mortality in children younger than four years old, especially in the developing  world. Diarrhea that lasts less than 2  weeks is termed acute diarrhea. Persistent diarrhea lasts between 2 and 4  weeks. Chronic diarrhea lasts longer than 4 weeks.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Diarrheal stools are those that take shape of the  container, so they are often described as loose or watery. Some people consider  diarrhea as an increase in the number of stools, but stool consistency is  really the hallmark. Associated symptoms can include abdominal cramps fever,  nausea, vomiting, fatigue and urgency. Chronic diarrhea can be accompanied by  weight loss, malnutrition, abdominal pain or other symptoms of the underling  illness. Clues for organic disease are weight  loss, diarrhea that wakes you up at night, or blood in the stools. These are  signs that your doctor will want to do a thorough evaluation to determine the  cause of your symptoms. Also tell your doctor if you have a family history of celiac  disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have unintentional weight loss,  fever, abdominal cramping or decreased appetite. Tell your doctor if you  experience bulky, greasy or very bad smelling stools.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Chronic  diarrhea is classified as fatty or malabsorption, inflammatory or most commonly  watery. Chronic bloody diarrhea may be due to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),  which is ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Other less common causes  include ischemia of the gut, infections, radiation therapy and colon cancer or  polyps. Infections leading to chronic diarrhea are uncommon, with the exception  of parasites.</p>
<p>  The two major  causes of fatty or malabsorptive diarrhea are impaired digestion of fats due to  low pancreatic enzyme levels and impaired absorption of fats due to small bowel  disease. These conditions interfere with the normal processing of fats in the  diet. The former is usually due to chronic  pancreatitis which is a result of chronic injury to the pancreas. Alcohol  damage to the pancreas is the most common cause of chronic pancreatitis in the  United States. Other causes of chronic pancreatitis include cystic fibrosis,  hereditary pancreatitis, trauma to the pancreas and pancreatic cancer. </p>
<p>  The  most common small bowel disease in the U.S. is celiac disease, also called celiac  sprue. Crohnâs disease can also involve the small bowel. Whippleâs disease,  tropical sprue, and eosinophilic gastroenteritis are some of the rare  conditions that can lead to malabsorption diarrhea.</p>
<p>There  are many causes of watery diarrhea, including carbohydrate malabsorption such  as lactose, sorbitol, and fructose intolerance. Symptoms of abdominal bloating  and excessive gas after consuming dairy products suggests lactose intolerance.  This condition is more common in African-Americans and Asian-Americans. Certain  soft drinks, juices, dried fruits and gums contain sorbitol and fructose, which  can lead to watery diarrhea in people with sorbitol and fructose intolerance. Diarrhea  is a frequent side effect of antibiotics. Certain other medications such as  NSAIDs, antacids, antihypertensives, antibiotics and antiarrhythmics can have  side effects leading to diarrhea.</p>
<p>Parasitic  intestinal infections such as giardiasis can cause chronic diarrhea. Diabetes  mellitus may be associated with diarrhea due to nerve damage and bacterial  overgrowth; this occurs mainly in patients with long-standing,  poorly-controlled diabetes. </p>
<p>  Irritable  bowel syndrome (IBS) is a condition often associated with diarrhea,  constipation or more frequently alternating diarrhea and constipation. Other common  symptoms are bloating, abdominal pain relieved with defecation and a sense of  incomplete evacuation. </p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>  Exposure  to infectious agents is the major risk factor for acute diarrhea. Bacteria and  viruses are often transmitted by the fecal-oral route, so hand washing and  hygiene are important to prevent infection. Soap and water are better because  alcohol-based hand sanitizers may not kill viruses. Medications such as  antibiotics and drugs that contain magnesium products are also common offenders.  Recent dietary changes can also lead to acute diarrhea. These including intake  of coffee, tea, colas, dietetic foods, gums or mints that contain poorly  absorbable sugars. Acute bloody diarrhea suggests a bacterial cause like <em>Campylobacter,  Salmonella</em> or <em>Shigella</em> or  Shiga-toxin <em>E. coli</em>. Travelerâs diarrhea is common in those who  travel to developing countries and results from exposure to bacterial pathogens  most commonly enterotoxigenic <em>E. coli</em>.  The best method of prevention is to avoid eating and drinking contaminated or  raw foods and beverages.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Most  episodes of acute diarrhea resolve quickly without antibiotic therapy and with  simple dietary modifications. See a doctor if you feel ill, have bloody  diarrhea, severe abdominal pain or diarrhea lasting more than 48 hours. In  patients with mild acute diarrhea, no laboratory evaluation is needed because  the illness generally resolves quickly. Your doctor may perform stool tests for  bacteria and parasites if your diarrhea is severe or bloody or if you traveled  to an area where infections are common. If you have severe diarrhea, blood  tests will be helpful to guide replacement of fluid and electrolytes and  minerals such as magnesium, potassium and zinc that can become depleted.</p>
<p>If  you have chronic diarrhea, your doctor will want to further assess etiologic  factors or complications of diarrhea by obtaining several tests. These can include  a blood count to look for anemia and infections, an electrolyte and kidney  function panel to assess for electrolyte abnormalities and renal insufficiency,  and albumin to assess your nutritional status.</p>
<p>A  stool sample may help define the type of diarrhea. The presence of fat, microscopic  amounts of blood, and <u>white</u> blood cells will help determine if a fatty,  inflammatory, or watery diarrhea is present. A bacterial culture and  ova/parasite studies of a stool specimen will also help determine if an  infectious etiology is present.</p>
<p>  Endoscopic  examination of the colon with flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy and upper  endoscopy are helpful in detecting the etiology of chronic diarrhea, as this  allows direct examination of the bowel mucosa and the ability to obtain  biopsies for microscopic evaluation. Double-balloon enteroscopy and capsule  endoscopy are sometimes used to examine the mucosa of the small intestine that  lies beyond the reach of conventional endoscopes.</p>
<p>Radiographic  studies such as an upper GI series or barium enema are not routinely performed  in the evaluation of chronic diarrhea, and have largely been replaced by  cross-sectional imaging. Ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen can be helpful  to evaluate the bowel, pancreas and other intra-abdominal organs.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>It  is important to take plenty of fluid with sugar and salt to avoid dehydration. Salt  and sugar together in a beverage help your intestine absorb fluids. Milk and  dairy products should be avoided for 24 to 48 hours as they can make diarrhea  worse. Initial dietary choices when refeeding should begin with soups and  broth.</p>
<p>  Anti-diarrheal  drug therapy can be helpful to control severe symptoms, and includes bismuth  subsalicylate and antimotility agents such as loperamide. These, however,  should be avoided in people with high fever or bloody diarrhea as they can  worsen severe colon infections and in children because the use of anti-diarrheals  can lead to complications of hemolytic uremic syndrome in cases of Shiga-toxin <em>E. coli</em> (<em>E. coli</em> 0157:H7).</p>
<p>  Your  doctor may prescribe antibiotics if you have high fever, dysentery, or moderate  to severe traveler's diarrhea. Some infections such as <em>Shigella</em> always require antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p> Treatment of  chronic diarrhea depends on the etiology of the chronic  diarrhea. Often, empiric treatment can be provided for symptomatic relief, when  a specific diagnosis is not reached, or when a diagnosis that is not  specifically treatable is reached. </p>
<p> Antimotility  agents such as loperamide are the most effective agents for the treatment of  chronic diarrhea. They reduce symptoms as well as stool weight. Attention  should be paid to replacing any mineral and vitamin deficiencies, especially  calcium, potassium, magnesium and zinc.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Diverticulosis refers to the presence of small out-pouchings (called diverticula) or sacs that can develop in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract.  While diverticula can be present anywhere in the intestines, they are most common on the left side of the large intestine, the area known as the descending and sigmoid colon.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/diverticulosis-and-diverticulitis/" class="faqquestion">How common is diverticulosis?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Diverticulosis is a common disorder, especially in older people.  The condition is uncommon in people under the age of 30 years of age, and is most common in those over 60.  Diverticulosis may be somewhat more common in men than in women.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/diverticulosis-and-diverticulitis/" class="faqquestion">What causes diverticulosis?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>No one knows for certain why diverticulosis develops; however, a few theories have been suggested. Some experts believe that abnormal intermittent high pressure in the colon due to muscle spasm or straining with stool may cause diverticula to form at weak spots in the colon wall. Historically, low-fiber diets were felt to play a role in the development of diverticulosis. However, recent studies suggest that this is not the case. In two studies, patients with diverticulosis were not more likely to have diets low in fiber or to be constipated than patients without diverticulosis. There also appears to be a genetic predisposition to diverticulosis; that is, if your parent or sibling has diverticulosis, you may be more likely to develop it than someone who does not have a family member with this disorder.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Most patients with diverticulosis have no symptoms or complications, and will never know they have the condition unless it is discovered during an endoscopic or radiographic (X-ray) examination.  Some individuals may experience chronic pain or discomfort in the left lower abdomen, bloating, and/or a change in bowel habits that may be related to having diverticulosis or a past history of diverticulitis.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Diverticulosis is generally discovered through one of the following examinations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Barium enema:</strong> This x-ray test involves putting liquid material into the colon through a tube placed in the rectum.  The x-ray image shows the outline of the colon, and can identify if diverticula, large polyps or growths are present. </li>
<li><strong>Colonoscopy:</strong> This test uses a thin, flexible tube with a light and camera to view the inside of the colon.  Diverticula as well as polyps and other abnormalities can be seen with this instrument. </li>
<li><strong>CT scan:</strong> This radiology test takes multiple cross-sectional pictures of the body.  It is not generally performed to make a diagnosis of diverticulosis, but this type of exam, when done for other reasons, may identify diverticula.</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/diverticulosis-and-diverticulitis/" class="faqquestion">Can diverticulosis be prevented or eliminated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>It is not known whether diverticulosis can be prevented.  As noted above, the amount of fiber that one eats does not appear to be related to the development of diverticulosis, so eating a high-fiber diet may not prevent diverticulosis. Individuals who are overweight or obese are more likely to have diverticulosis.  Smoking may also increase the possibility of developing diverticulosis.  Therefore, maintaining a healthy weight and abstaining from smoking may decrease the possibility of developing diverticulosis.  Once diverticula have formed, they do not go away.</p> 
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/diverticulosis-and-diverticulitis/" class="faqquestion">Can diverticulitis be prevented?</a>
<div class="faqanswer"> 
<p>People with diverticulosis are sometimes instructed to avoid foods that contain indigestible particles such as popcorn, nuts, and fruits with small seeds.  However, a large study with detailed information on diet found that people who frequently ate nuts or popcorn were NOT more likely to experience diverticulitis than those who did not eat these foods. Therefore, it is no longer recommended that people with diverticulosis or diverticulitis avoid these foods.</p> 

People who eat a diet high in fiber are less likely to develop diverticulitis than those who eat little fiber (although, as noted above, a high-fiber diet does not appear to decrease the chances of developing diverticulosis). Reducing the amount of red meat in the diet may also decrease the possibility of diverticulitis. 
<p>Studies show that people who maintain a healthy weight and/or exercise regularly are less likely to develop diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding than those who are overweight or who do not exercise.  Avoiding smoking is also likely to help prevent diverticulitis, especially perforated diverticulitis.</p> 

<p>Minimizing the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen and aspirin, may decrease the chances of developing diverticulitis.  However, if you take aspirin for your heart or blood vessels, you should not stop aspirin without talking to your doctor.  Opiate narcotics and corticosteroids also appear to predispose to diverticulitis.</p>

<p>Several different medications have been studied in hopes of preventing recurrent diverticulitis in patients who have had one or more attacks. Unfortunately, the best studied drug, mesalamine, has not reduced the likelihood of recurrent diverticulitis. There are only a few small studies on the use of probiotics (healthy bacteria) or rifaximin (a kind of antibiotic), so it isnât clear if these medications might help reduce recurrent diverticulitis.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/diverticulosis-and-diverticulitis/" class="faqquestion">What are the complications of diverticulosis?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Diverticulitis is inflammation of one or a few diverticula in the same area of the colon (usually the sigmoid or descending colon). Diverticulitis occurs in less than 5% of people who have diverticulosis.  People with diverticulitis characteristically present with the fairly sudden onset of pain in the abdomen, usually on the lower left side. Other common symptoms include fever, diarrhea and/or constipation, decreased appetite, nausea and fatigue.</p>

<p>People with diverticulitis can develop related complications including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abscess</strong> â a collection of infected fluid outside of the intestinal/colon wall.</li>
<li><strong>Stricture</strong> â a narrowing of the colon in the area of diverticulitis</li>
<li><strong>Fistula</strong> â a connection between the bowel and nearby organs including the bladder or the vagina. </li>
<li><strong>Perforation</strong> â a hole in the colon that allows bowel contents to leak into the abdomen. This is the most serious complication of diverticulitis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bleeding can occur from a rupture in one of the vessels that lines a diverticulum. Bleeding from diverticulosis is a less common complication of diverticulosis than diverticulitis.  Patients with this condition typically pass a large amount of red or maroon blood from the rectum.  The bleeding tends to occur without warning and there is no associated abdominal pain. Most bleeding will stop on its own.  However, endoscopic examination of the colon may be necessary to diagnose and treat the bleeding.  Nuclear medicine bleeding scans (a type of radiology test) can also be used to identify the site of the diverticular bleeding if endoscopy does not or if bleeding is very severe.  Occasionally, angiography (injection of dye into the abdominal blood vessels by a radiologist) is needed to identify and treat diverticular bleeding.  In rare cases in which endoscopic or radiologic management fails to control the bleeding, surgery may be necessary to remove the part of the colon that is bleeding.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/diverticulosis-and-diverticulitis/" class="faqquestion">How is diverticulitis Treated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
  <p>Diverticulitis is typically treated with antibiotics and a liquid or low-residue diet until symptoms improve (similar to a low-fiber diet). However, some studies suggest that patients with mild diverticulitis who do not have an abscess or perforation (see above), and are otherwise healthy can be managed without antibiotics.  People with severe diverticulitis (high fever, signs of severe infection) or with complications (abscess, perforation) require antibiotics and are usually treated in the hospital. Radiologic guided drainage (via a tube placed in the abdomen) may be needed to drain large abscesses. Surgery may be needed for cases that do not respond to medical management or for patients with perforation. A temporary colostomy (drainage of stool from the intestine into a bag on the outside of the abdomen) may be required during surgery for complicated diverticulitis.  The colostomy is usually temporary.</p>

What is dysphagia?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Dysphagia is the medical term used to describe difficulty  swallowing. Dysphagia includes difficulty starting a swallow (called <em>oropharyngeal  dysphagia) </em>and the sensation of food being stuck in the neck or chest  (called <em>esophageal dysphagia</em>). Oropharyngeal dysphagia can result from  abnormal functioning of the nerves and muscles of the mouth, pharynx (back of  the throat) and upper esophageal sphincter (muscle at the top end of the  swallowing tube). Diseases that involve the swallowing tube (esophagus) can  cause esophageal dysphagia. When a patient is being evaluated for  dysphagia, it is important for the doctor to determine which type of dysphagia  is more likely, oropharyngeal or esophageal, as different tests are ordered for  each type.</p>
  <p>Dysphagia needs to be distinguished from <em>odynophagia</em>,  which is defined as pain during swallowing. This can arise from infection  or inflammation in the esophagus. Dysphagia also needs to be  distinguished from <em>globus sensation</em>. This is a constant sensation of  something being stuck at the back of the throat, which does not typically make  swallowing difficult. In contrast, dysphagia is a symptom that only  occurs when attempting to swallow. Globus can sometimes be seen in acid  reflux disease, but more often, it is due to increased sensitivity in the  throat or esophagus.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/dysphagia/" class="faqquestion">What causes dysphagia?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Just as there are two types of dysphagia â oropharyngeal and  esophageal dysphagia â there are similarly two broad groups of causes for  dysphagia. Within each broad group, there are two subgroups of causes:  neuromuscular (involving the nerve or muscle), and structural, where the  esophagus is narrowed or compromised.</p>
  <p><u>Oropharyngeal dysphagia</u>: Neuromuscular causes  are more frequent than structural causes for this type of dysphagia. This  is because the nerves controlling the muscles of the mouth, back of throat  (pharynx) and top end of the esophagus (upper esophageal sphincter) have direct  connections with the brain through cranial nerves, and can therefore be damaged  in diseases involving the brain or cranial nerves.</p>
  <p>Less common than neuromuscular causes are structural causes,  including strictures (narrowed areas), or rarely tumors growing in the back of  the throat.</p>
  <p><u>Esophageal dysphagia</u>:Â  In this type of  dysphagia, structural causes are far more frequent than disorders involving  nerves or muscles. Therefore, narrowing in the esophagus from scarring  due to acid reflux disease, inflammation of the lining of the esophagus  (usually from acid reflux disease but occasionally from infections), tumors  within the esophagus, and compression of the esophagus from growths in the  chest or sometimes even an enlarged heart can all cause dysphagia. In  addition, a unique type of inflammation caused by a type of blood cell called  eosinophils can cause dysphagia; this condition is called eosinophilic  esophagitis.</p>
  <p>Less common are disorders involving the nerves and muscle of  the esophagus.Â  The esophageal muscle can be weak and sometimes unable to  generate adequate pressure during contraction. In extreme situations, the  muscle generates no force and is unable to squeeze â this is sometimes called  scleroderma esophagus (even though scleroderma is not frequently the cause), and can be associated with dysphagia. Another disorder of the nerves and  muscles is achalasia; a condition in which the muscle at the bottom end of the  esophagus cannot relax during swallowing because of abnormal nerve control. The muscle in the body of the esophagus also does not squeeze normally in  achalasia, and becomes weak and stretched.Â  When the nerves are abnormal to a lesser degree, spasm of the esophagus may result, which can also cause  dysphagia.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/dysphagia/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of dysphagia?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>By definition, dysphagia is the sensation that food or  liquids do not pass normally from the mouth to the stomach. Symptoms can  vary depending on the location of the abnormality causing dysphagia. When  the patient has oropharyngeal dysphagia from a neuromuscular cause, muscles  involved in chewing and in pushing food to the back of the throat may also be  involved. In general, dysphagia occurring within one second of trying to  swallow is due to oropharyngeal dysphagia. The muscles that protect the nose  and the voice box (larynx) during swallowing may be defective in their  function, causing the patient to have food and drink come out through the nose  or enter the airway through the larynx (voice box) while trying to swallow  (called âaspirationâ). Food entering the larynx can cause choking,  coughing, or even lead to a type of pneumonia called aspiration  pneumonia. There may be a change in the patientâs voice (husky voice or  hoarse voice) because of involvement of nerves that control the vocal  cords. The trouble swallowing is typically felt in the region of the back  of the throat.</p>
  <p>With esophageal dysphagia, food may be swallowed normally,  but may get stuck in the neck or chest. Sometimes, swallowed food comes  back up (regurgitation), when it may taste like the food just eaten. Difficulty swallowing is usually worse with solids than with liquids.  Symptoms of acid reflux disease such as heartburn may also be present, since  reflux is the most common cause of narrowing in the esophagus causing dysphagia.  Even though the abnormality may be at the bottom end of the esophagus, the  sensation of food being stuck may be felt higher up in the chest or even in the  neck region. Rarely, food may actually block the esophagus (food  impaction) â this will result in a total inability to swallow, including  liquids, and usually requires urgent endoscopy to remove the food bolus.  Achalasia, a condition where the esophagus fails to relax and allow food to  pass, may be difficult to diagnose because symptoms progress slowly. In  achalasia, difficulty may occur with both solids and liquids, and symptoms may  be severe enough to cause weight loss. Patients with esophageal spasm can have  chest pain as well.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/dysphagia/" class="faqquestion">What are the tests that are done in patients with dysphagia?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The first step is to distinguish between oropharyngeal  dysphagia and esophageal dysphagia from the patientâs symptoms. The  evaluation begins with a careful history from the patient, which can provide  direction towards the cause of dysphagia in the majority of patients.  Tests performed on patients with dysphagia depend on whether the doctor thinks  that the patient has oropharyngeal or esophageal dysphagia.</p>
  <p>Investigation of oropharyngeal dysphagia starts with a  careful neurologic examination to identify which nerves and muscles might be  abnormal. Swallowing function testing of the mouth and throat can be performed  with videofluoroscopy or modified barium swallow. This test involves  giving the patient food items of different consistency (e.g. cookie,  marshmallow) containing barium and observing the swallow on an x-ray screen  (fluoroscopy). This test can show if the barium enters the larynx  (opening to the breathing tube) while attempting to swallow, or if it passes  normally through the upper esophageal sphincter, and can help determine how the  patient can position his or her head or neck to make each swallow effective.</p>
  <p>A tiny endoscope can be introduced through the nose to the  back of the throat to see the act of swallowing â this test is called nasal  endoscopy. This test can also be used to stimulate the back of the throat  with a jet of air to see if the muscle responds or if it is paralyzed.  When tumors of the back of the throat or back of the brain are suspected, a CT  scan or a MRI scan of the head and neck may be useful. Measurement of  pressures within the back of the throat during swallowing (manometry) is less  useful, but the newer high resolution manometry techniques can be considered if  other tests fail to find an abnormality. Finally, blood tests can be useful to  diagnose myasthenia gravis, polymyositis and other muscle disorders.</p>
  <p>Endoscopy (examination of the esophagus using a tube with a  light and a video camera at the end) is one of the tests used in the evaluation  of esophageal dysphagia. This test not only allows the doctor to inspect  the lumen and lining of the esophagus, but samples of abnormal tissue can be  taken for examination and if appropriate, treatment can be performed by  stretching out narrowed areas. Another test that can be used is to take  x-rays while the patient swallows barium (barium swallow or esophagram).  This is most useful when the esophagus is expected to have very tight  narrowing. If a narrowing is not seen on either endoscopy or barium  swallow, measurement of pressures within the esophagus while swallowing sips of  water (manometry) can help find out if the muscle of the esophagus squeezes or  relaxes abnormally while swallowing, and can diagnose conditions like achalasia  or esophageal spasm.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/dysphagia/" class="faqquestion">What is the treatment of dysphagia?<a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>For the most part, the treatment of dysphagia depends on the  cause. Treatment often involves making a change in the foods eaten or the  consistency of food. The modified barium swallow may identify foods of certain  consistencies that can be swallowed better than others. The test can also  identify head and neck positions that facilitate swallowing.</p>
  <p>Patients with narrowing of the esophagus benefit from stretching (dilating) the  esophagus. Several techniques are available for dilation. Balloons  can be passed through the endoscope and distended to stretch the narrowing, or  dilators (long rubber or plastic cylinders of various sizes) can be passed  through the mouth, sometimes over a guide wire. Since narrowing is usually  related to acid reflux disease, treatment with an acid lowering agent is  usually recommended. Patients with eosinophilic esophagitis are treated  with acid lowering agents or steroid preparations sprayed to the back of the  throat and swallowed. Dilation is also affective but should be performed  with caution to avoid tears; dilation is usually done if steroid preparations  do not improve dysphagia in eosinophilic esophagitis. When the narrowing  is from inoperable cancer, wire or metal stents (thin expandable tubes) can be  placed during endoscopy to keep the lumen of the esophagus open allowing food  and liquid to pass through. Patients with achalasia improve when the  muscle at the bottom end of the esophagus is disrupted, either with a large  balloon (pneumatic dilation) or during surgery where the muscle is cut  (myotomy). Sometimes, botulinum toxin (BOTOXÂ®) can be injected into the  muscle at the bottom end of the esophagus to make it relax, but this treatment  only results in short term improvement in achalasia.</p>
  <h3>Can I expect my dysphagia to improve?</h3>
  <p>This depends on the cause of dysphagia. Dysphagia from  strictures (narrowings) in the esophagus may improve very well with stretching  of the esophagus, but repeat endoscopic sessions for stretching may be  necessary from time to time. Dysphagia from acid reflux disease,  esophageal infections and eosinophilic esophagitis may resolve completely with  medicines. Dysphagia from achalasia improves with either surgery or  forceful dilation of the lower end of the esophagus, but the esophagus remains  dilated. When the cause of dysphagia cannot be treated, alternative  options include placing a metal or wire stent to keep the esophagus open,  especially when the narrowing is due to a cancer.</p>
  <p>With both types of dysphagia, if symptoms are present over a  long period of time, patients may lose weight and become malnourished.  Weight loss can be worse when the cause is cancer of the esophagus, or if there  is a very tight narrowing or obstruction in the esophagus. Dehydration  can occur if there is difficulty swallowing liquids. Sometimes, if  esophageal blockage is nearly complete, it can be bypassed to avoid some of  these problems, by placing a tube into the stomach for feeding (percutaneous  gastrostomy tube). This is also sometimes performed in oropharyngeal  dysphagia when the risk of food and liquids entering the lungs and causing  pneumonia is high.</p></div>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>No one knows the exact reason why a person gets stomach cancer. Researchers have learned that there are certain risk factors associated with the development of stomach cancer. Those over the age of 55 years are more likely to get stomach cancer. Men are affected twice as often as women and African Americans are affected more commonly than Caucasians.</p>

<p>Stomach cancer is more common in some parts of the world such as Japan, Korea, parts of Eastern Europe and Latin America. Some studies do suggest that a type of bacteria known as Helicobacter pylori, which can cause inflammation and ulcers in the stomach, can be an important risk factor for developing gastric cancer.</p>
<p>Studies show that people who have had stomach surgery or have a condition such as pernicious anemia, or gastric atrophy (which result in lower than normal production of digestive juices) can be associated with an increased risk of developing gastric cancer.</p>
<p>There is also some evidence that smoking increases the risk of developing gastric cancer.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/stomach-cancer-gastric-cancer/" class="faqquestion">How is gastric cancer diagnosed?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>In addition to taking a complete history and performing a physical exam, your doctor may do one or more of the following tests:</p>

<p><u>Upper GI series</u>- The patient is asked to drink a barium solution. Subsequently x-rays of the stomach are taken. The barium outlines the inside of the stomach helping to reveal any abnormal areas that may be involved with cancer. This test is used less often than it used to be, and patients now often undergo endoscopy (see below) first.</p>
<p><u>Endoscopy</u>- A lighted, flexible tube with a camera, called an endoscope, is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus and then into the stomach. Sedation is given prior to insertion of the endoscope. If an abnormal area is found, biopsies (tissue samples) can be taken and examined under a microscope to look for cancer cells.</p>
<p>If cancer is found, the doctor may schedule additional staging tests to determine if the cancer has spread. A CT scan may be used to determine if cancer has spread to the liver, pancreas, lungs or other organs near the stomach.</p>
<p>Staging of gastric cancer may also be performed by using endoscopic ultrasound. Endoscopic ultrasound can help to determine the depth of spread of the tumor into the wall of the stomach and involvement of adjacent structures as well as assess for any enlarged lymph nodes that may be invaded with cancer cells.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/stomach-cancer-gastric-cancer/" class="faqquestion">What is the treatment for stomach cancer?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Treatment plans may vary depending on the size, location, extent of tumor and the patient's overall health. Treatments include surgery, chemotherapy and /or radiation therapy.</p>

<p>Surgery is the most common treatment. The surgeon can remove part of the stomach (gastrectomy) or the entire stomach. Lymph nodes near the tumor are generally removed during surgery so that they can be checked for cancer cells.</p>

<p>Researchers are exploring the use of chemotherapy before surgery to help shrink the tumor and after surgery to help kill residual tumor cells. Chemotherapy is given in cycles with intervals of several weeks depending on the drugs used.</p>

<p>Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy rays to damage cancer cells and stop them from growing. Radiation destroys the cancer cells only in the treated area.</p>

<p>Doctors are looking at the combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy to see what combination would have the most beneficial effect.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-incontinence/" class="faqquestion">What is fecal incontinence?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Fecal  incontinence is the inability to control your bowel movements, causing stool  (feces) to leak unexpectedly from your rectum. Also called bowel or anal  incontinence, fecal incontinence can range from occasional leakage of a small  quantity of stool while passing gas to a complete loss of bowel control.</p>
<p>The ability to hold stool (called <em>continence</em>)  requires the rectum, anus and nervous system to be working normally. Two groups  of muscles in the wall of the anus and rectum are responsible for holding the  stool in the rectum, the outer muscle group (external anal sphincter) and the  inner muscle group (internal anal sphincter). Normal continence also requires  the ability to sense the presence of stool in the rectum (called <em>rectal  sensation</em>), and the ability to relax and store stool (called <em>rectal  compliance</em>) when having a bowel movement is not convenient. In addition,  you need the physical and mental capabilities to recognize the urge to  defecate, and go to the toilet.</p></div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-incontinence/" class="faqquestion">Is it a common condition?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Yes. More than 5.5 million Americans have fecal incontinence. It is more common in older people and in women. However, many people do not like to talk about fecal incontinence, and it may not be apparent that fecal incontinence is relatively common. If you have fecal incontinence and have not discussed the symptom with a physician or family members, you are not alone.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-incontinence/" class="faqquestion">What causes fecal incontinence?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Fecal incontinence is commonly caused by altered bowel habits (generally diarrhea, but also constipation) and conditions that affect the ability of the rectum and anus to hold stool. The sphincter muscles become weaker as you grow older. The sphincters muscles or the nerves supplying them can be damaged during vaginal delivery in women, by trauma, or during anal surgery. Nerve malfunction can also happen in people who strain excessively, in patients with diabetes or after a stroke. The rectal wall can stiffen after radiation treatment or in patients with Crohn's disease. In these patients, the rectum cannot stretch as much as it needs to, so the excess stool leaks out. Other conditions where the rectum drops down into the anus (rectal prolapse) or when the rectum protrudes into the vagina (rectocele) can also cause fecal incontinence.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-incontinence/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of fecal incontinence?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Normally, âaccidentsâ or fecal leakage should not happen in adults except during episodes of severe diarrhea. People with chronic or recurring fecal incontinence may have few or frequent accidents. The symptoms may range from the inability to hold gas, âsilentâ leakage of stool during daily activities or exertion, or being unable to reach the toilet in time. Other intestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation and abdominal discomfort may also be present.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-incontinence/" class="faqquestion">What can you do if you have fecal incontinence?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Doctors understand the emotional and social consequences of fecal incontinence, so donât be embarrassed about talking to your doctor about this problem. Your primary care physician may be able to assist you, or you may need to see a doctor who specializes in treating conditions that affect the colon, rectum and anus, such as a gastroenterologist, proctologist or colorectal surgeon. Your doctor will talk to you about your symptoms and perform a physical examination, including a rectal examination. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may perform one or more tests to identify the cause for incontinence. These tests include measuring pressures in the anus and rectum (anal manometry), using an anal ultrasound or MRI scan to look at the anal muscles and surrounding tissues, using barium studies to see how the rectum and anus perform during defecation (defecography) and testing to see if the nerves supplying the anal muscles are functioning normally (anal electromyography or EMG).</p>

<p><strong>Anal manometry</strong>Â is conducted with a short flexible tube in the anus and rectum. This test measures the strength of the anal sphincter, and can also measure rectal sensation.</p>

<p><strong>Anorectal ultrasonography</strong>Â is performed by placing a small, balloon-tipped ultrasound probe into the rectum. Pictures of the anal sphincters are taken as the ultrasound probe is withdrawn.</p>

<p><strong>For defecocraphy</strong> liquid barium is placed in the colon and rectum with a small rectal tube while you lie on a table. After the rectal tube is removed, you will be asked to sit on a specially designed toilet. An x-ray video will be made while you are sitting on the toilet. You will be asked to cough, squeeze the âcheeksâ of your buttocks together, and expel your rectal contents. After defecating, you will be asked to bear down as if you were having a bowel movement.</p>

<p>Similar to ultrasound, <strong>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</strong> can take pictures of the anal sphincters with a small probe in your rectum. Like barium defecography, MRI can also obtain pictures of the pelvic floor muscles and rectum while you squeeze muscles and expel contents; these pictures are obtained after adding ultrasound gel in your rectum.</p>

<p><strong>Proctosigmoidoscopy</strong>Â &ndash; Your doctor will use a long, slender tube with a tiny video camera attached to examine your rectum and sigmoid â approximately the last 2 feet of your colon. This test can identify inflammation, tumors or scar tissue that may cause fecal incontinence.</p>

<p><strong>Anal electromyography (EMG)</strong> &ndash; Tiny needle electrodes will be inserted into muscles around your anus to identify nerve damage.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-incontinence/" class="faqquestion">Is there any treatment for fecal incontinence?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Fortunately,  effective treatments are available for fecal incontinence. Treatment for fecal  incontinence can help improve or restore bowel control. Depending on the cause  of your incontinence, treatment may include dietary changes, medications,  special exercises that help you better control your bowels, or surgery.</p>
<p>Foods that can  cause diarrhea and worsen fecal incontinence include spicy foods, fatty and  greasy foods, cured or smoked meat, and dairy products (especially if you are  lactose intolerant). Caffeine-containing beverages can act as laxatives, as can  products which contain artificial sweeteners (e.g., sugar-free gum and diet  soda). Several anti-diarrheal agents (e.g., loperamide, anticholinergic agents,  clonidine, bile salt binding agents, alosetron) that can effectively treat diarrhea  are now available. Some of these agents (e.g., loperamide) are available  over-the-counter while others are prescription only. Some medications work  better for patients than others.</p>
<p> If you have  constipation, your doctor may suggest that you eat fiber-rich foods, and  prescribe fiber supplements. On the other hand, if you have diarrhea, your  doctor may recommend anti-diarrheal medications (e.g., loperamide (Imodium)) or  fiber supplements to help bind stool. </p>
<p>If fecal  incontinence is due to a lack of anal sphincter control or decreased awareness  of the urge to defecate, you may benefit from a bowel retraining program and  exercise therapies that will help you improve muscle strength in the vicinity  of your anus. In some cases, bowel training means learning to go to the toilet  at a specific time of day. For example, your doctor may recommend that you make  a conscious effort to have a bowel movement after eating. This helps you gain  greater control by establishing with some predictability when you need to use  the toilet. Most agree that use of loperamide comprises a first line treatment  for fecal incontinence, before moving to biofeedback. In other cases, bowel  training involves an exercise therapy called biofeedback. For fecal  incontinence, biofeedback involves inserting a pressure-sensitive probe into  your anus. This probe registers the strength of your anal sphincter. You can  practice sphincter contractions and learn to strengthen your own muscles by  viewing the scale's readout as a visual aid. These exercises can strengthen  your rectal muscles. It is also possible to improve rectal sensation with  biofeedback therapy.</p>
<p>If you leak  large amounts of stool frequently, consider applying a moisture-barrier cream  to prevent direct contact between irritated skin and feces. Ask your doctor to  recommend a product. Be sure the area is clean and dry before you apply any  cream. Non-medicated talcum powder or cornstarch also may help relieve anal  discomfort. Wear cotton underwear and loose clothing and change your soiled  underwear quickly. If you use pads or adult diapers, be sure they have an  absorbent wicking layer on top; this layer wicks moisture away from your skin.</p>
<p>If a rigorous trial of the conservative measures specified  above is not effective, surgery or a less invasive procedure (e.g., sacral  nerve stimulation, injection of biomaterials) may be considered. </p>
<p>The sacral nerves travel from the spinal cord to muscles in  the pelvis. These nerves regulate rectal sensation and strength of the anal  sphincter muscles. Sacral nerve stimulation is carried out in stages. First,  small needles are positioned in the sacral nerves traveling from the spinal  cord to muscles of your lower bowel, and these muscles are stimulated by an  external pulse generator to identify which muscle stimulates anal contractions  the most. The muscle response to the stimulation generally isn't uncomfortable.  If this procedure improves symptoms over 2-3 weeks, a permanent pulse generator  may be implanted.</p>
<p>Injection of a  silicone-based material into the anal sphincter may improve incontinence by narrowing  the anal canal. </p>
<p>A  sphincteroplasty, which is an operation to repair a damaged anal sphincter, may  be beneficial in women who have fecal incontinence due to anal sphincter damage  caused by childbirth. Other operations, such as an artificial sphincter or a  muscle transplant (graciloplasty) are not done very often because they are  often associated with complications. A colostomy is the last resort to treat  fecal incontinence. A colostomy is an operation that diverts stool through an  opening in the abdomen instead of through the rectum. A special bag is attached  to this opening to collect the stool.</p>
<p>There are many options to help patients with fecal  incontinence. Make an appointment with a gastroenterologist for an evaluation.</p>

What are the signs and symptoms of foodborne illness?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The most common symptoms of foodborne illness are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and fevers.    Some symptoms start within hours and others do not start until days to weeks after eating or drinking the offending item.  More serious symptoms such as bloody bowel movements or bloody vomiting, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, headaches, confusion, changes in vision, weakness, muscle paralysis, or hallucinations can be a sign of a severe infection that should be evaluated immediately by a medical professional.  Medical attention should be sought if your temperature is greater than 100.4Â°F (38Â°C) or if symptoms lead to an inability to eat, drink, or stay hydrated.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/foodborne-illnesses/" class="faqquestion">
What are the potential long term effects of foodborne illness?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The majority of symptoms of foodborne illness go away in a few days. However symptoms can last for weeks to months, years or even for life.  Certain types of infections can cause new long-term disease or can worsen pre-existing illnesses.  Some people may experience ongoing abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, or cramping.  Other long-term symptoms can involve skin, nerves and muscles, the heart, or joints.  Any symptoms that last for more than 48 hours should be evaluated by a physician.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/foodborne-illnesses/" class="faqquestion">
What are the causes of foodborne illness?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Although food allergies as well as toxic chemicals can cause symptoms similar to those described above, the focus of this paper will be on illness caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites.</p>
<p></p>
<strong>Bacteria</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Salmonella</em>â Salmonella infection is the most common bacterium causing foodborne illness and leads to the highest number of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States.    Foods most commonly contaminated by Salmonella include poultry, fresh produce (fruits and vegetables), eggs, meats such as beef and pork, and dairy products.  This infection can cause symptoms of fever, diarrhea containing blood or mucous, and severe abdominal pain.</li>

<li><em>Campylobacter</em> â Campylobacter infections are common and can lead to serious short and long-term illnesses. Like Salmonella, Campylobacter can cause fever, bloody diarrhea and severe abdominal pain but can also have long-term complications that include inflammation/damage of joints or nerve damage leading to muscle weakness that can be life threatening.  Like Salmonella, foods that are associated with Campylobacter infections include poultry, dairy, produce and meats such as pork and beef. </li>

<li><em>Escherichia coli (also known as E. coli)</em> â There are many different types of E. coli that can cause symptoms ranging from watery diarrhea and abdominal pain to bloody diarrhea that can be associated with a severe infection that involves injury to the kidneys, blood vessels / clotting, and nervous system. E. coli associated with these infections lives in the intestinal tract of cattle making beef, unprocessed milk, and contaminated produce the most common sources for E. coli infections. </li>

<li><em>Listeria</em> â Listeria infections are most significant in the very young, very old, pregnant women or immunosuppressed patients such as organ transplant recipients, or patients with cancer, diabetes, or HIV, and those who are on chronic immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or steroids.  While Listeria can cause watery bacteria in patients with a normal immune system, more severe symptoms to include infections of the brain can occur in very young, very old, or immunosuppressed patients.  Pregnant women need to be particularly cautious as Listeria infection can lead to miscarriage or premature birth.  Pregnant mothers may only experience mild symptoms of fever, chills, or back pain with this infection. Listeria can be transmitted through deli meats, undercooked pork and poultry, produce and seafood.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<strong>Viruses</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Norovirus and Rotavirus</em> â Both of these viruses tend to produce symptoms of nausea, vomiting, mild fevers, headache, and watery diarrhea. Rotavirus usually infects children more than adults. Norovirus is most common in adults but can affect any age group and is frequently associated with large outbreaks in restaurants/catered events, hospitals, schools, and vacation destinations including cruise ships. Infected individuals usually pass these viruses on to others by not properly washing their hands after going to the bathroom, and then preparing food or beverages. </li>

<li><em>Hepatitis A</em> â Hepatitis A is a virus that can cause injury to the liver and is most commonly transmitted through contamination of food or water by the feces of infected individuals. Hepatitis A infections usually appear with a mild flu-like illness with symptoms including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, fevers and abdominal pain.  These infections can become more severe and include darkening of the urine, light colored bowel movements, itching, as well as yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<strong>Parasites</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora</em> â these two parasites can cause diarrhea, fevers, fatigue and can lead to infections of the liver, bile tract, gallbladder, and pancreas.  Cryptosporidium is carried by cattle and typically infects immunosuppressed patients through contaminated water, produce, and unpasteurized milk. In contrast Cyclospora has been documented to be transmitted by fresh produce such as berries and basil as well as contaminated water sources.  The infections tend to be short lived but can persist for weeks to months.</li>

<li><em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> â Toxoplasma is a parasite that can only reproduce in cats and causes infections when people ingest the parasiteâs cysts usually through soil, food or water contaminated with cat feces.  Similar to Listeria infections, it is important for pregnant females to be aware of toxoplasma as it can be transmitted from contaminated foods or litter box exposure to the mother and then to the fetus.  The most common foods associated with toxoplasma contamination are beef, produce, poultry, dairy, and deli meats.</li>

<li><em>Giardia Lamblia</em> â This parasite may cause symptoms, including abdominal cramps, bloating and diarrhea. Individuals with immunoglobulin deficiencies (especially Immunoglobulin A) and low gastric acidity (as in elderly patients), are especially susceptible. Giardia Lamblia is usually transmitted by drinking contaminated water.</li>

Who is at risk for acquiring foodborne illness?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Everyone is at risk for and will probably have a foodborne illness at one time in their lives. However, these illnesses typically only require medical attention when the symptoms described above become severe.  There are certain populations that are at increased risk for severe illness with foodborne infections for whom medical attention should be sought if any concern exists. These include the very young, very old, pregnant women, immunosuppressed patients such as organ transplant recipients, or patients with cancer, diabetes, or HIV, and those who are on chronic immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or steroids.  Patients that suffer from chronic liver disease, alcoholism, or have decreased stomach acid production through surgery or chronic acid suppressing medications (such as proton pump inhibitors, for example esomeprazole, rabeprazole, or omeprazole) are also at increased risk.</p>

How is foodborne illness diagnosed?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Foodborne illness is usually diagnosed based on your symptoms and the circumstances surrounding the start of your illness.  Often the cause of the illness is not determined, particularly if symptoms are short lived. Common questions your medical provider may ask you that can help in determining the cause of your illness may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your symptoms? Have you ever had similar symptoms before?</li>
<li>Have you had any bloody bowel movements or bloody vomit, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, headaches, confusion, changes in vision, weakness, muscle paralysis, or hallucinations?</li>
<li>What foods did you eat at or around the time these symptoms began? </li>
<li>Did you eat any new or unusual foods? Did you eat in a new or unusual location/restaurant?</li>
<li>Have you traveled recently? Have you been campling?</li>
<li>Do you have pets?</li>
<li>How long prior to the onset of symptoms did you eat the food in question?</li>
<li>Did anyone eating with you also become ill? What symptoms did they have?</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the history of illness, your provider may order blood or urine tests, imaging (X-rays or CT scan), or even an endoscopy. If you are having diarrhea a very important part of the diagnosis includes evaluating a sample of your bowel movement for the type of infection causing your symptoms. Collecting your stool is important not only for determining treatment but also allows public health officials to recognize if there is an outbreak of foodborne illness that needs to be further investigated.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/foodborne-illnesses/" class="faqquestion">
How can I prevent getting a foodborne illness?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Perhaps the most important part of avoiding foodborne illness is ensuring food safety:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean â Washing hands and food preparation surfaces frequently can decrease the risk of infections.  Proper hand washing should include soap and warm, running water for at least 20 seconds after handling food, using the bathroom, changing diapers, or handling pets and their waste. Wash knives/utensils, cutting boards, and counter tops with warm soapy water preparing each food item before continuing with food preparation. Washing fruits and vegetables, even those with peels, with running water can prevent the spread of infections.</li>

<li>Separate â Bacteria, viruses and parasites can spread illness if they cross contaminate the foods being prepared which often results from foods that are not properly separated. This is best done through using separate cutting boards and plates for fruits/vegetables and meat/poultry/seafood/eggs. These items should also be physically separated in your shopping cart and in storage/refrigerators in your home.</li>

<li>Cook â Cooking all foods to a proper internal temperature can ensure the killing of bacteria, viruses and parasites.  Using a food thermometer ensures proper internal food temperatures are achieved.  Relying on color and texture is not sufficient to ensure food safety. Reheated/microwaved foods should be heated to at least 165Â°F / 74Â°C. </li>

<li>Chill â Perishable foods should be refrigerated in 2 hours or less in a refrigerator set no higher than 40Â°F and a freezer at no higher than OÂ°F. All thawing and marinating should be done in the refrigerator as bacteria can rapidly multiply on foods left at room temperature.  Guidelines for storage times for refrigerated foods can be found at <a href="http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/storagetimes.html" target="_blank">www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/storagetimes.html</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>More recommended food safety information can be found online at <a href="http://www.foodsafety.gov" target="_blank">www.foodsafety.gov</a>.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/foodborne-illnesses/" class="faqquestion">
What foods should high risk individuals avoid?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>High risk individuals (very young, very old, pregnant women, immunosuppressed patients such as organ transplant recipients, or patients with cancer, diabetes, or HIV, and those who are on chronic immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or steroids) should avoid the following foods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw or smoked fish/shellfish, meat, or poultry</li>
<li>Raw or unpasteurized cheeses or milk or juices, soft cheeses (feta, Brie, Camembert), Mexican style cheese (queso blanco, queso fresco)</li>
<li>Raw or undercooked eggs or foods containing them such as certain salad dressings, sauces, and beverages</li>
<li>Hot dogs/dry or fermented sausages, pÃ¢tÃ©s , meat spreads, luncheon meats (cold cuts,  deli meats)</li>
</ul>
<div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/foodborne-illnesses/" class="faqquestion">
How are foodborne illnesses treated?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The treatment of foodborne illness is primarily supportive. Supportive treatment includes drinking adequate fluids/ensuring proper hydration, eating small, low fat meals, and resting as needed.  Because these illnesses can be passed from person to person, ensuring proper hygiene (hand washing, care with diaper changing) as well as staying home from work or school are important in preventing the spread of these infections.</p>

<p>Antibiotics are not usually necessary, although they may be required in certain types of bacterial or parasitic infections.  Anti-diarrheal medications such as loperamide are not generally recommended and should typically be avoided unless recommended by a physician.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, more serious symptoms such as bloody bowel movements or bloody vomit, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, headaches, confusion, changes in vision, weakness, muscle paralysis, or hallucinations can be a sign of a severe infection that should be evaluated immediately by a medical professional.  Furthermore, medical attention should be sought if your temperature is greater than 100.4Â°F (38Â°C) or if symptoms lead to an inability to eat, drink, or stay hydrated.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Abdominal pain that cannot be explained by any visible or  detectable abnormality, after a thorough physical examination and appropriate  further testing if needed, is known as functional abdominal pain. Functional  abdominal pain can be intermittent (recurrent abdominal pain or RAP) or  continuous. Although the exact cause is not known, nerve signals or chemicals  secreted by the gut or brain, may cause the gut to be more sensitive to  triggers that normally do not cause significant pain (such as stretching or gas  bloating). Because of this change in bowel function, this type of abdominal  pain is often referred to as âfunctional abdominal pain.â</p>
<p>Functional abdominal pain is one of the most common  complaints of children and adolescents who are seen by gastroenterologists who  care for young patients. In fact, almost a quarter of all children seen for  stomach or intestinal complaints have functional abdominal pain. </p>
<p>Functional abdominal pain includes several different types  of chronic abdominal pain, including recurrent abdominal pain, functional  dyspepsia, and irritable bowel syndrome. Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) was  originally defined about 50 years ago as three or more bouts of abdominal pain  (belly ache) in children 4-16 years old over a three-month period severe enough  to interfere with his/her activities.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Usually, the pain is located around the umbilicus (belly  button), however the pattern or location of abdominal pain is not always  predictable. The pain may occur suddenly or slowly increase in severity. The  pain may be constant or may increase and decrease in severity. <strong></strong></p>
<p>  Some children with functional abdominal pain may experience dyspepsia, or  upper abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and/or a feeling of  fullness after just a few bites (early satiety). Others may experience  abdominal pain with bowel movements. Pain that is usually relieved by bowel  movements, or associated with changes in bowel movement habits (mainly  constipation, diarrhea, or constipation alternating with diarrhea) is the  classic irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).Â  <strong>Â </strong></p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The trigger for functional abdominal pain varies from one  patient to another, and may transform over time even in the same patient. The  exact triggers may not be easily identified but may remain moving targets for  treatment. Nerve signals or chemicals secreted by the gut or brain, may cause  the gut to be more sensitive to triggers that normally do not cause significant  pain (such as stretching or gas bloating). Because of this change in bowel  function, this type of abdominal pain is often referred to as âfunctional  abdominal pain.â</p>
<p>Most young children will point to the umbilicus (belly  button) when asked to describe the location of abdominal pain. However, pain  centered around the belly button could be due to a number of causes that should  be considered when evaluating a child with chronic abdominal pain. Some of  those causes are not very serious while other causes require close and long  term care. Possible causes that should be considered based on the history,  physical examination and testing, are acid reflux, constipation, lactose intolerance,  parasitic infections of the small and large intestines, infections of the  stomach with a germ called <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> (that is associated with ulcers  in the first portion of the small bowel), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)  such as Crohnâs disease and ulcerative colitis, celiac disease which is a  sensitivity to cereal grains, food allergies, inflammation of the liver  (hepatitis), gall bladder problems, an inflamed pancreas,Â  an intestinal obstruction (blockage),  appendicitis, and many more rare disorders. </p>
<p>It must be emphasized that typically, none of these more  severe problems cause abdominal pain in most children with chronic or recurrent  bellyaches. Instead, the pain is usually âfunctionalâ. </p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>In some cases,  children previously suffering from anxiety, depression and other psychiatric  disorders may show an exaggerated pain response. Sometimes, the parent and the  child may not be consciously aware of any stress or emotional  disturbances.Â Other possible risk  factors are thought to be physically or emotionally traumatic experiences, and  preceding gastrointestinal infections. Parents and children need to be  reassured that functional abdominal pain is not life threatening. However,  functional abdominal pain may have negative effects on the childâs physical and  psychological state. The pain may interfere with school attendance,  participation in sports and other extra-curricular activities. Infrequently, it  may affect appetite and sleep. The changes in the daily routine may affect the  childâs mood and emotions, and in turn cause depression and anxiety.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Detailed information regarding the location of abdominal  pain, the frequency (number of times per week) and duration of a typical  episode, and association with other complaints will in most cases provide  useful clues about the cause, and will guide further testing. Other important  pieces of information, known as âred flagsâ or âalarm signsâ that a physician  may inquire about include weight loss, poor growth, fever, joint pains, mouth  ulcers, unusual rashes, loss of appetite, blood that appears in the vomiting or  stool, and night time awakening due to diarrhea and abdominal pain.Â The doctor will also ask about the effects of  foods and beverages upon the pain, and relationship to stools, sleep, physical  activities, and emotional stress. </p>
<p>The diagnosis of functional abdominal pain is often based on the report  of symptoms and normal physical examination. It is also quite possible that the  doctor may obtain some tests. The reason for these tests is to look for signs  of any serious disease. These screening tests may initially include blood and  stool tests. The results of screening tests often guide the doctor in deciding  whether further tests are needed or whether a trial of diet changes, stress  management or medication may be started. Testing should be limited if the  history is typical for functional abdominal pain and the childâs physical  examination is normal.Â In that case,  many doctors prefer to treat without testing in order to avoid the discomfort  of testing or the slight risk associated with testing. Of course, if the history, the physical  examination, or the results of screening tests are abnormal, further testing may  be required.Â This further testing may  include a test to confirm lactose intolerance, ultrasound of the abdomen, a CT  of the abdomen, and upper GI series (radiology test), and possibly an endoscopy  (scope). The scope allows the doctor to use a special camera on the scope to  look at the inner lining of the food pipe, stomach, first and last portion of  the small intestine and the large intestine. At the time of the scope, biopsies  (small pinches of the lining) are also obtained and examined under the  microscope for signs of certain infections and disorders like IBD and celiac  disease. Normal test results in a child without alarm signs or red flags  strongly suggest RAP or one of the other types of functional abdominal pain,  such as irritable bowel syndrome or functional dyspepsia.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>If a specific cause  for abdominal pain is discovered during the evaluation, the physician will  discuss specific management of conditions like constipation, lactose  intolerance, infections, IBD, celiac disease, and food allergies. If no  specific cause is found and functional abdominal pain is suspected, the child  needs to be reassured that his or her abdominal pain is accepted as a real  disorder and not something that is âjust in the headâ. The goal of managing  functional abdominal pain is to provide a satisfactory quality of life through  support, education, medicines and better coping skills.Â  Reassurance about the good outcome of  functional abdominal pain and the positive aspects of the childâs health are  crucial. Addressing the parentsâ and childâs concerns and fears and identifying  emotional or psychological stressors are also important. As noted before, some  tests may be needed during the evaluation of functional abdominal pain, but it  is also important for parents and children to know that doing too many  unnecessary tests may be frustrating to the family and child. If functional  abdominal pain is strongly suspected as the likely diagnosis, testing should be  limited to the most useful, simple and relatively non-invasive tests.Â  </p>
<p>The child may benefit  from certain dietary changes depending on his/her history. These are  recommended on a case-by-case basis. The physician may advise avoidance of  greasy and spicy foods, caffeine, juices, and carbonated drinks. Eliminating  lactose (a natural sugar in milk and other dairy products) from the diet may  benefit those who suffer from lactose intolerance in addition to functional  abdominal pain. Some children with abdominal pain who also experience âgasâ may  improve by<strong> </strong>eating food slowly and by avoiding carbonated  drinks, and gas forming foods such as cabbage, or beans. In addition, fruit  drinks, sugar-free chewing gum, and sugar free candy sweetened with an alcohol  called sorbitol should be avoided.Â   Sorbitol, which tastes sweet, cannot be properly digested, and when  taken in large amounts, it can cause cramping, bloating, and even diarrhea.</p>
<p>Some children may be  candidates for medications, if functional abdominal pain is significantly  limiting the daily routine. These medications include anti-spasmodic medicines  for those with crampy pain in relation to bowel movements, laxatives for those  with constipation, and acid-suppressing medicines for those with pain and  dyspepsia. If the child does not respond to any of these treatments, he or she  may benefit from low doses of medicines called tricyclic antidepressants (used  at much higher doses to treat depression). At low doses, these medicines can be  excellent pain relievers for some children. A fearful, anxious, or depressed  child however should be fully assessed by a psychiatrist or psychologist. Some  psychological treatments that help children cope with functional abdominal pain  and other stressors, include behavioral therapy, relaxation exercises and  hypnosis. It is very important that the physician, parents, and school  encourage the child resume a normal routine.Â Â Â  <br />
</p>
<p>Fortunately, the diagnosis of functional abdominal pain has  a good outcome overall, with almost half of these children getting better on  their own or with treatment within a few weeks to months. A supportive and  understanding environment at home and school is important to keep the child  physically and mentally healthy.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gallstones-in-women/" class="faqquestion">
Did you know that women are at increased risk for gallstones?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Gallstones occur in up to 20% of American women by the age of 60. Women between the ages of 20 and 60 years are three times more likely to develop gallstones than men.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Factors for Development of Gallstones</strong></p>
<ul>
        <li>Multiple pregnancies</li>
        <li>Family history of gallstones</li>
        <li>Hispanic or American Indian heritage</li>
        <li>Obesity</li>
        <li>Rapid loss of weight</li>
      </ul>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gallstones-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What is the gallbladder and what does it do?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The gallbladder is a pouch that sits beside the liver and stores bile. Bile is a green-yellow fluid produced by the liver. After eating, the gallbladder releases bile into the intestines where it helps with digestion. Although the gallbladder helps with natural food digestion, people can live a normal life without it.</p>


<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gallstones-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What are gallstones?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Gallstones are solid clumps of cholesterol crystals and other substances that may be of variable size.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gallstones-in-women/" class="faqquestion">How are gallstones formed?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Bile is composed of fatty substances, like cholesterol. When excessive amounts of fat are present, crystals form. Over time, these crystals can combine and form stones. The initial formation of these stones does not cause pain or symptoms.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gallstones-in-women/" class="faqquestion">Are all gallstones the same?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>No. There are different types of gallstones, depending on which fatty substances of the bile has solidified. Also, the stones can vary in size, ranging from a single grain of sand up to the size of a ping-pong ball.</p>

<p>About 90% of gallstones are composed of cholesterol. The remainder consist of pigmented material (bilirubin). The reason for the formation of pigment stones is not yet fully understood. However, some people with blood disorders such as Sickle Cell Anemia or Thalassemia are at increased risk for developing pigmented stones.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gallstones-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What symptoms are associated with gallstones?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Most persons with gallstones (80%) have no symptoms of pain. These people are said to have "silent" gallstones.</p>

<p>Patients with symptomatic gallstones usually experience pain in the right upper region of the abdomen, but sometimes pain may localize to the right shoulder or chest. When the pain of a "gallbladder attack" lasts longer than 1 to 2 hours, or is associated with fever, you should see your doctor immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Other Complications of Gallstones</strong></p>
  
<ul>
<li>Yellow eyes and skin = jaundice</li>
<li>Gallbladder infection = cholecystitis</li>
<li>Bile duct infection = cholangitis</li>
<li>Infection in the blood = sepsis</li>
<li>Pancreas inflammation = pancreatitis</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gallstones-in-women/" class="faqquestion">Will everyone with silent gallstones eventually have a gallbladder attack?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>No, the risk of silent gallstones causing a gallbladder attack is about 1% per year. In other words if 100 persons had silent gallstones, only ten would have a gallbladder attack after 10 years, and 90 would still have no symptoms.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gallstones-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What tests are needed to diagnose gallstones?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Since 80% of persons with gallstones have no symptoms, it is important to realize that tests for gallstones are only needed when symptoms are present. Your doctor will know which of the following tests would be best for you.</p>

<p><em>Abdominal Ultrasound:</em> this is the safest, simplest and most readily available test to diagnose gallstones. Sonar waves from a probe are passed over the abdomen to visualize the gallbladder and detect the presence of stones. This test is not an x-ray and can be safely performed during pregnancy.</p>

<p><em>OCG (Oral Cholecystogram):</em> this is an x-ray test. Iodine pills are given and an x-ray taken the following day. This test should not be performed during pregnancy.</p>

<p><em>CT Scan (computerized tomography):</em> this test uses x-rays which are not safe during pregnancy. This test is not very accurate for diagnosing gallstones.</p>

<p><em>Nuclear Scan (HIDA, DISIDA):</em> This test involves injection of a tiny amount of radioactive tracer into the blood, which quickly accumulates in the liver and gallbladder and can be seen with a special camera. This is a very accurate and safe test during an acute attack, but generally is not recommended during pregnancy.</p>

<p><em>ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatogram):</em> This is a very important x-ray test that is used only in special cases. It is generally not done during pregnancy. Sometimes, the ERCP test is the only way to diagnose gallstones or stones that have migrated into the bile duct. This procedure may be used to remove gallstones that have migrated into the bile duct and sometimes avoid the need for surgery.</p>

<p>Infection of the bile ducts is called cholangitis. This is a very serious medical illness, characterized by abdominal pain, fever, yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), and even infection in the blood stream. When cholangitis occurs, the ERCP test is usually done on an emergency basis to remove obstructing stones and drain the infection.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/gallstones-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What are the treatment options?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Persons with symptomatic gallstones should usually undergo surgery to remove the gallbladder.</p>

<p><em>"Open" cholecystectomy:</em> the classic traditional treatment for gallstones. This procedure requires an abdominal incision. The patient remains in the hospital for five to seven days.</p>

<p><em>"Laparoscopic" cholecystectomy:</em> the newer and often preferred treatment, where the gallbladder is removed with a lighted tube (called a laparoscope) through a small incision in the abdomen. The surgeon views the entire procedure on a television monitor. Most patients leave the hospital after a few of days.</p>

<p><em>Dissolution of Gallstones:</em> ursodeoxycholic acid, ActigalÂ®, is a medicine that can be given as a pill to dissolve gallstones. Therapy requires at least 6 to 12 months and is successful in dissolving stones in 40-80% of cases. When surgery is too risky, the symptoms are mild, the stones are small, and rich in cholesterol, dissolution of gallstones is a reasonable alternative.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Gastroparesis  literally translated means âstomach paralysisâ. Gastroparesis is a digestive  disorder in which the motility of  the stomach is either abnormal or absent. In healthy people, when the stomach is  functioning normally, contractions  of the stomach help to crush ingested food and then propel the pulverized food  into the small intestine where further digestion and absorption  of nutrients occurs. When the condition of gastroparesis is present the stomach  is unable to contract normally, and  therefore cannot crush food nor propel food into the small intestine properly. Normal digestion may not occur.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Symptoms of gastroparesis include bloating, nausea, early fullness while eating meals, heartburn, and epigastric pain. These symptoms are often referred to as dyspepsia. Ingestion of solid foods, high fiber foods such as raw fruits and vegetables, fatty foods or drinks high in fat or carbonation may cause symptoms. Perhaps the most common symptom is early satiety, or the sensation of feeling full shortly after starting a meal. Nausea and vomiting are also common. A person with gastroparesis may regurgitate or vomit undigested food many hours after their last meal. Weight loss can occur due to poor absorption of nutrients, or taking in too few calories.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_key><![CDATA[_acg_gi_patients_cpt_basics_sectioncontent_5]]></wp:meta_key>
			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[  <p>There are many  causes of gastroparesis. Diabetes is one of the most common causes for gastroparesis. Other causes include infections,  endocrine disorders like  hypothyroidism, connective tissue disorders  like scleroderma, autoimmune  conditions, neuromuscular diseases, idiopathic (unknown) causes, psychological  conditions, eating disorders, certain cancers, radiation treatment applied over  the chest or abdomen, some  chemotherapy agents, and surgery of the upper intestinal tract. Any surgery on  the esophagus, stomach or duodenum  may result in injury to the vagus nerve which is responsible for many sensory  and motor (muscle) responses of the  intestine. In health, the vagus nerve sends neurotransmitter impulses to the  smooth muscle of the stomach that result in contraction and forward propulsion of gastric contents. If the vagus nerve  is injured by trauma or during surgery gastric emptying may be reduced. Symptoms of postoperative gastroparesis may develop immediately, or months to  years after a surgery is performed.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that medications prescribed for a variety of conditions may have side effects  that cause gastric emptying to  slow down. The most common drugs that delay stomach  emptying are narcotics and certain antidepressants. Table 1 lists more medications that may delay stomach emptying. If  possible, patients having dyspeptic symptoms, vomiting or early fullness should  discontinue the offending medications before  undergoing any motility tests. Fortunately, gastric emptying resumes and  symptoms improve when medications causing âpseudo-gastroparesisâ are stopped. It  is important to have the names of  all your medications recorded and  with you when you see a physician for  evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms. </p>
<p>People with  eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa or  bulimia may also develop delayed  gastric emptying. Gastric emptying may resume and  symptoms improve when food intake and eating schedules normalize.</p>

<p>Medications  that cause slow emptying should typically be stopped, and reversible conditions  (example: hypothyroid) treated prior to testing. A history of early satiety, bloating, nausea, regurgitation or  vomiting with meals would normally  prompt an evaluation to determine the cause of symptoms. Inflammation, ulcer  disease, or obstruction by a tumor can also cause these symptoms and diagnostic  tests would be used to determine the cause. Radiographic tests, endoscopic  procedures, and motility tests are used to exclude obstruction, to view the  stomach lining and obtain biopsies, and to examine muscle contraction patterns.  These tests are described below.</p>
<p><u>Upper Endoscopy</u> is a test that is performed by  inserting a thin flexible tube through the mouth into the stomach. The  endoscope has camera capabilities and allows the upper gastrointestinal tract  to be evaluated for ulcers, inflammation, infection, cancer, hernias or other abnormalities. These conditions can cause symptoms similar to gastroparesis. Upper endoscopy usually  requires 10-15 minutes to complete. Medication is usually administered  intravenously immediately before the test for comfort  and sedation. If abnormal findings  such as an ulcer or inflammation are  noted biopsies can be obtained. Fluid samples may be collected testing for  bacterial overgrowth.</p>
<p><u>Gastric Emptying Study</u> is a widely available nuclear medicine test that examines the rate of emptying  of solid or liquid material from the  stomach. A delay in gastric emptying indicates a diagnosis of gastroparesis. Subjects consume an egg and toast or oatmeal meal along with milk or orange  juice. The food portion contains a tiny amount of the radioactive material (99m  Tc), which is measured by a scanning technique as it empties from the stomach. A  longer test can examine if small intestine transit is also affected. </p>
<p><u>Scintigraphic Gastric Accommodation</u> is a test that measures the volume of stomach contents before and after a meal, and how well the stomach relaxes  in response to food intake. This test uses a tiny amount of radioactive  material (99m Tc) which  is selectively taken up by the lining of the stomach, and indirectly measures  the volume of the stomach. The subject consumes a nutrient drink over 30 seconds. A scan of the stomach is taken before  and after the nutrient drink. The test indicates whether the stomach relaxes  appropriately when filled. Symptoms of poor  stomach relaxation can be identical to poor  emptying, and this test can help distinguish the processes. Scintigraphic  gastric accommodation is not readily available.</p>
<p><u>Gastroduodenal manometry</u> is a test that measures how well the smooth muscle of  the stomach and small intestine contracts and relaxes. The test is performed by placing a thin tube into the stomach  usually with the aid of the endoscope. The tube is advanced into the small  intestine and over the next few hours the contractile responses while the  subject is fasting and eating are observed and recorded. The manometry catheter provides information  on how strong and how often the muscles of the stomach and intestine contract  and whether the stomach contractions are coordinated  with the contractions in the small bowel. Gastric duodenal manometry may be  helpful but is often not needed to make a diagnosis of gastroparesis. This test  is not widely available.<br />
  <br />
<u>A Small Intestinal X-ray</u> is a contrast radiograph used to outline the  anatomy of the small bowel. This study is not generally needed to make a  diagnosis of gastroparesis, but a blockage anywhere in the small intestine will  result in a back up of material and could account for  delayed gastric emptying. An obstruction in the small bowel may cause symptoms  similar to gastroparesis, but the treatment is different. Treatment for intestinal obstruction is avoiding intake of any  food or liquid until the cause of  obstruction such as inflammation resolves or  surgery is performed to remove the  blockage.</p>
<p><u>Wireless capsule GI monitoring system (SmartPillÂ®)</u><br />
The wireless capsule monitoring  system is a non-digestible capsule that records  pH, temperature and pressure changes as it travels through the intestine  (figure 3).Â The information from the wireless capsule is transmitted to  a receiver worn by the patient  around their waist.Â The information is used to determine how fast or slow the stomach empties, and similarly how food  and liquid move through the intestine.Â The test is done in an outpatient setting, takes generally 3-6 hours and  within 24-72 hours the pill is passed from the body.Â A potential advantage of the wireless capsule  system over conventional gastric emptying or  scintigraphy would be that the study could be done in the outpatient setting  and would not involve radiation, though the amount of radiation used in  alternative tests is very small and not considered harmful.Â Occasionally, if the capsule is not passed  within three days your doctor may  request an abdominal x-ray to assure it has left the body.Â Use of the wireless capsule monitoring system is not recommended in patients who have  had previous surgery to decrease the amount of acid they are secreting, in  patients who are unable to stop their antacid medications for the study or  in patients with narrowing of the bowel lumen.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<h3>Importance  of Nutrition as Treatment in Gastroparesis</h3>
<p>Diet is one of  the mainstays of treatment for those  who suffer from gastroparesis. Some foods are more  difficult than others for the  stomach to digest. Fatty foods take a longer time to digest, as do foods that  are fibrous, like raw vegetables. People with gastroparesis should reduce their  intake of fiber or avoid these  foods. Fiber when eaten should be chewed well and cooked until soft. Food that  is poorly digested can collect in  the stomach and form what is called  a bezoar. This mass of undigested matter may cause a blockage, preventing the  stomach from emptying and result in nausea and pain. In such a case, it may be  necessary to use endoscopic tools to break the bezoar apart and remove it. Fortunately, even when stomach emptying is  significantly impaired, thick and thin liquids (e.g. pudding and nutrient  drinks) are usually tolerated and can pass through the stomach. Many people  with gastroparesis can live a relatively normal  life with the aid of supplemental nutritional drinks, soft foods the consistency  of pudding and by pureeing solid food in a blender.</p>
<p>Feeding tubes  placed in the small intestine (jejunostomy) may be required if gastric  paralysis is severe and a person is unable to manage with a pureed or soft diet. These feeding tubes are usually placed  endoscopically or surgically through  the skin and directly into the small intestine (figure 1). Before such a feeding tube is placed, a temporary nasal or  oral jejunal feeding tube is usually  tried for a few days to make sure  the individual can tolerate this form  of feeding into the small bowel. The temporary  feeding tube is usually placed by guiding it through the nose or mouth, down the esophagus or  âfood pipeâ, through the stomach and finally into the small intestine with the  aid of an endoscope (figure 2).</p>

<h3>Medications  Prescribed for Gastroparesis</h3>
<p>At the present  time there are few medications available or  are approved to treat gastroparesis and their use can be limited by undesirable  side effects and limited effectiveness.  The medications available include metoclopramide, domperidone, erythromycin and  cisapride.</p>
<p><u>Metoclopramide</u> is a medication that acts on  dopamine receptors in the stomach  and intestine as well as in the brain. This medication can stimulate  contraction of the stomach that leads to improvement in emptying. This  medication also has the effect of acting on the part of the brain responsible for controlling the vomiting reflex and therefore may decrease the sensation of nausea and the  urge to vomit. Use of this medication is limited in some people due to the side  effects of dystonia, agitation and muscle twitching or  âtardive dyskinesiaâ. Metoclopramide can also cause restlessness, insomnia, depression,  as well as painful breast swelling and nipple discharge in both men and women.  It is not recommended that this medication be taken long term. It comes in tablet,  liquid, intravenous, as well as a new under-the-tongue disintegrating form.</p>
<p><u>Domperidone</u> is another  medication, similar to metoclopramide, that acts on dopamine receptors. Domperidone does not have the side effect of  tardive dyskenisia and agitation that are seen with metoclopramide because it  acts mostly on peripheral receptors, rather than in the brain. Domperidone is  not available in the United States  but is used in Mexico and Canada and in  some European countries. It is available in oral and suppository forms.</p>
<p><u>Erythromycin</u> is a commonly used antibiotic  that binds to receptors in the stomach  and small intestine called âmotilin receptorsâ.  Stimulation of motilin receptors  results in contraction and improved emptying of the stomach. The beneficial  effect of erythromycin can be short  lived as individuals who use it frequently have a high likelihood of developing  tolerance to the medication. Perhaps the best use of erythromycin is for acute worsening of symptoms or used on an intermittent basis in order to reduce  the potential for tolerance. It is  available in pill, liquid and intravenous forms.</p>
<p><u>Cisapride</u> binds to serotonin receptors located in the wall of the stomach that leads to  contraction of stomach smooth muscle and improved gastric emptying. In the late  1990âs cisapride was taken off the market due to complications of cardiac  arrhythmias in patients who were using this drug. It is once again available  but its use is restricted. Individuals with underlying kidney or heart disease should not use cisapride.</p>

<h3>Therapies  Under Investigation for Gastroparesis</h3>
<p>Serotonin  receptor agonists have been used as treatment for other motility disorders and may offer some promise for the treatment of gastroparesis. Acetylcholine  esterase inhibitors have been shown in some clinical trials to improve symptoms  of dyspepsia. Ghrelin agonists are motilin-related peptides that accelerate  gastric emptying, small intestine transit and improve postoperative ileus.  Cholecystokinin receptor antagonists have been shown to reverse slow gastric  emptying caused by a high fat meal. Many of these treatments are currently  under investigation as treatments for gastroparesis.</p>
<h3>Surgery for Gastroparesis</h3>
<p>Surgery for gastroparesis is reserved for  individuals with severe and refractory  symptoms, intolerance to therapy, or  malnutrition related to the condition. Venting tubes placed into the stomach  may reduce symptoms and hospitalizations for  individuals with recurrent vomiting and dehydration. Varieties of tubes,  including button gastrostomy tubes and percutaneous gastrostomy tubes are  available to vent trapped air from within the poorly  contracting stomach. A dual channel gastrostomy tube allows both gastric  venting and nutritional supplementation delivered into the small intestine. A  percutaneous jejunostomy tube is used for  nutritional supplementation. In some cases the lower part of the stomach is  stapled or bypassed and the small  intestine reattached to the remaining stomach to improve emptying of stomach  contents. Rarely the stomach is completely removed. </p>

<h3>Electrical  Gastric Stimulation</h3>
<p>An area generating a great deal of interest and  research is the use of electrical stimulation to enhance gastrointestinal contractile  activity. This technique uses electrodes that are surgically or endoscopically attached to the stomach wall and  when stimulated, trigger stomach contractions (figure 4). While gastric  electrical stimulation does not lead to a significant improvement in gastric  emptying, in the subgroup of patients with nausea and vomiting as their main  symptoms, this treatment may provide relief of symptoms. How the device works is not well understood at this point, but it is  thought that it has its effect on the nerves that control sensation within the  stomach wall. Several studies have shown patients have a better quality of life  and spend less time in the hospital for  gastroparesis symptoms after the placement of the electrical stimulator.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/laparoscopic-obesity-surgery/" class="faqquestion"> History of Bariatric Surgery
</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
  <p>Surgery for obesity (Bariatric  surgery) is not a new field but has been around for over 50 years. The first significant gastrointestinal  operative procedures for weight loss were the intestinal bypasses.Â These procedures, first described in the  1950&rsquo;s, involved the connecting (anastomosing) of the very proximal piece of  the small intestine called the jejunum to the very distal part of the small  intestine called the ileum, or even the colon.Â In doing so, approximately 90% of the small intestine&rsquo;s absorptive  surface area was no longer exposed to nutrients taken in. Although intestinal  bypasses were successful for achieving significant weight loss, it came at the  high price of significant complications.Â Patients universally suffered from chronic diarrhea and foul smelling  flatus.Â Additionally many suffered from  protein malnutrition, vitamin and macronutrient deficiencies, joint and muscle  aches, and renal stones. Most  troublesome, some patients developed cirrhosis and even liver failure.Â After decades of use, these procedures were  no longer performed.Â  In 1979, Dr. Nicola  Scopinaro introduced a redesigned intestinal bypass called the &ldquo;biliopancreatic  diversion.&rdquo;Â This procedure delivers  significant weight loss results and does not have many of the severe long term  consequences of the intestinal bypasses.Â A more recent variant is the biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal  switch, or just &ldquo;duodenal switch&rdquo; for short (Figure 4).Â However, the complexity of these procedures  and the risk of protein, vitamin, and mineral deficiencies have limited them to  less than 5% of all bariatric procedures performed.</p>
  <p>In the mid 1960&rsquo;s, Dr. Edward Mason  described the first experience with gastric bypass for weight loss.Â This procedure was thought to be much safer  than the intestinal bypass because it had minimal if any malabsorption.Â The main mechanism of action was the  restriction of nutrient intake by the creation of a very small gastric pouch  which was connected directly to the intestine thereby &ldquo;bypassing&rdquo; the vast  majority of the stomach and the proximal small intestine.Â At that time, the gastric bypass was a  formidable operation in obese patients.Â In  response, less complicated gastric restrictive procedures were developed.Â These procedures were known as  &ldquo;gastroplasties&rdquo; and were very popular in the 1970&rsquo;s and 1980&rsquo;s. These  procedures partitioned the stomach typically with surgical stapling devices to  create small stomach pouches.Â Although  safer and less complex than the gastric bypass, the results were inferior and  these procedures declined in popularity.Â In the mid 1990&rsquo;s, the gastric bypass was first successfully performed laparoscopically  (Figure 2).Â The ability to now perform  gastric bypasses laparoscopically, significantly reduced the operative  complications, increased the acceptability of the gastric bypass.</p>
  <p>In addition to the introduction of  laparoscopy, there was another major advance and that was the introduction of  the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (Figure 1). This relatively simple and safe procedure  behaved like a gastroplasty in that it creates a small gastric pouch but did so  without staple-partitioning the stomach. The procedure has a very low  complication rate. Another beneficial  feature of the band is its adjustability.Â The band can be tightened or loosened in a simple office procedure  thereby allowing the band to be uniquely adjusted for each individual  patient.Â Band popularity sky rocketed  worldwide but has recently diminished due to inferior results compared to the  gastric bypass and also to the introduction of a new procedure known as the  sleeve gastrectomy (Figure 3).</p>
  <p>The sleeve involves the removal of  the outer crescent of the stomach leaving behind a very small stomach remnant  that holds only a few ounces.Â The sleeve  has become very attractive for patients wanting good results with less of the  risk and complexity of the gastric bypass.</p>
  </div>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/laparoscopic-obesity-surgery/" class="faqquestion">Current Bariatric Surgical Procedures</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Currently,  patients considering bariatric surgery have the choice of four bariatric operative  procedures; the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (Figure 1), roux-Y gastric  bypass (Figure 2), sleeve gastrectomy (Figure 3), and the biliopancreatic  diversion with or without duodenal switch (Figure 4).</p>

<br>
The overwhelming majority of bariatric  surgeons perform these procedures laparoscopically. Each has the potential to result in  meaningful and sustainable weight loss and the related improvements in many  comorbid conditions. Additionally, these  procedures are performed with remarkably low morbidity and mortality  rates.Â The mortality rates range from as  low as 0.1% of the band to less than 1% for the duodenal switch.
  <p>As a further testament to the drive  for safety, in the mid 2000&rsquo;s, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric  Surgery established a &ldquo;Centers of Excellence Program&rdquo; to insure that high  standards for safety and quality of care were followed universally not just at  certain centers. Shortly thereafter, the  American College of Surgeons created a similar program. Between both entities, the vast majority of  bariatric surgery programs in the U.S. are designated as &ldquo;Centers of  Excellence&rdquo; and practice bariatric surgery at high levels of competence.</p>
  </div>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/laparoscopic-obesity-surgery/" class="faqquestion">Who is a Candidate for Bariatric Surgery?</a>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The current requirements for  qualification for bariatric surgery have not changed in over 20 years. These requirements were established by the  National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the 1991 NIH Consensus Statement. At the time, the only operative procedures  being performed were the gastric bypass and the vertical banded gastroplasty.Â Based on the best available evidence at that  time, the panel considered the potential risks of surgery against possible  benefits and established the minimum criteria for considering patients for surgery  as the following: a body mass index (BMI) of 35-39 kg/m<sup>2</sup> if they  suffer from obesity-related comorbidities, and a BMI <u>&gt;</u>40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>,  regardless of the presence or absence of comorbidity. Candidates for surgery  should have failed attempts to achieve sustainable weight loss with  nonoperative strategies (although no specific weight loss method was required).Â Some health insurance companies mandate that  their clients must complete a structured preoperative weight loss program  before authorizing coverage for surgery.Â They often stipulate that the program be &ldquo;physician-supervised&rdquo; and  include monthly visits for a duration of 3 to 6 months. The value of such a requirement  is debatable.</p>
<p>Although these standards have changed little in over  2 decades, much has changed in the field.Â As mentioned above the introduction of laparoscopy and new procedures  such as the band and sleeve have dramatically reduced bariatric surgery  complications. Given these observations  and the growing evidence of the benefits of surgery for the treatment of  conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, many bariatric surgeons and a  growing number of non-bariatric surgeon clinicians support allowing patients  with type II diabetes and BMI <u>&gt;</u> 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to consider  bariatric surgery. A small but growing  body of literature also supports this consideration.</p>
</div>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/laparoscopic-obesity-surgery/" class="faqquestion">Surgical Outcomes and Benefits</a>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The most remarkable aspect of  bariatric surgery is the fact that after surgery, weight loss is only one of  the dramatic benefits realized by patients.Â Currently all of the conventional operative procedures can result in  meaningful and sustainable weight loss.Â The range in weight loss varies with the procedure from a low of approximately  40% of excess achieved by the band to about 75% of excess for the realized by  the duodenal switch.Â Additionally, the  majority of patients will maintain significant weight loss for long term  duration.</p>
<p>Even potentially more significant  than the weight loss, is the improvement and even resolution of a large number  of obesity-related health issues and diseases such as type II diabetes mellitus,  hypertension, and sleep apnea, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Several long term studies have also discovered that  bariatric surgery may reduce the risk of several types of cancers including  breast, colon, prostate, uterus, liver, and pancreas.Â Additionally, studies have shown a potential  reduction in the risk of heart disease.  Given all of these potential health benefits, it is therefore of no  surprise that bariatric surgery has also been shown to improve quality of life.</p>
</div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/laparoscopic-obesity-surgery/" class="faqquestion">Surgical Risks and Complications</a>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>It is no great secret that all  surgical procedures carry some degree of risk and consequences. Bariatric surgery involves the performance of  complicated surgical procedures in complicated patients. It is therefore not surprising that the  potential for catastrophic complications and even death exists with all of the  operative procedures.Â However, as stated  above, the introduction of advanced laparoscopic techniques, improved  perioperative care, and the participation in the &ldquo;Centers of Excellence&rdquo; programs have  resulted in dramatic reductions in complications.</p>
<p>Overall complication rates are  relatively low.Â For the band, band  erosion occurs in 1-2%, band prolapse in 1-2%, and port problems in  approximately 4%. Sleeve complications  include a 1-2% risk of leak and a 2% risk of stricture. The overall complication rate for the gastric  bypass is 10-15%. This includes a leak  rate of 1-2%, anastomotic stricture rate of 1-2%, a bleeding rate of 3-4%, and  a 1% risk of bowel obstructions.</p>
<p>For all procedures, the risk of  blood clots is less than 1%.Â Vitamin and  mineral deficiencies are more common with the sleeve, gastric bypass, and the  duodenal switch secondary to malabsorption but can even be seen with the band  due to dietary derangements.Â It is  therefore imperative that patients who undergo any type of weight reduction  surgery have regular follow up with a physician who can monitor for these  deficiencies.</p>
</div>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/laparoscopic-obesity-surgery/" class="faqquestion">Future Considerations</a>

<div class="faqanswer">
  <p>Despite  the low complication rates and good results, currently less than 1% of  potential patients undergo bariatric surgery.Â While there are several factors that contribute to this phenomenon, one  of the most significant is that many patients are just not interested in the  current operative choices.Â They are  concerned about the risks, do not want to have their gastrointestinal tracts  permanently altered, and/or do not want to be exposed to the potential long  term issues (i.e. vitamin supplementation, dietary restrictions). Many have expressed the desire for simpler,  less risky options.Â With so few patients  undergoing surgery, there is a tremendous opportunity for innovative new  therapies to be introduced.Â Several are  currently under investigation involving either endoscopic-based approaches or  laparoscopically implanting electric pulse generator devices onto the  gastrointestinal tract.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/laparoscopic-surgery/" class="faqquestion">
What is laparoscopic surgery?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Laparoscopic surgery refers to a special technique by which the surgeon performs the surgery through several small holes in the abdomen with the aid of a camera. It is also known as âminimally invasive surgeryâ. These incisions are much smaller than would have been required using traditional surgical techniques. Generally the operation that is performed is still the same operation, even though the incisions are much smaller.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/laparoscopic-surgery/" class="faqquestion">What advantages does laparoscopic surgery have over conventional surgery?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Laparoscopic surgery usually results in reduced hospital stays, fewer wound infections, less pain, and a faster recovery time. From a surgeonâs perspective, laparoscopic surgery may allow for easier dissection of abdominal scar tissue (adhesions), less surgical trauma, and improved outcomes in certain groups like the elderly and extremely overweight individuals.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/laparoscopic-surgery/" class="faqquestion">What are the indications for laparoscopic surgery?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>These days, many surgeries that were once performed âopenâ (longer incisions of the abdominal wall allowing direct visualization of abdominal contents) can be performed laparoscopically. The laparoscopic surgeon can operate upon many organs, including but not limited to the colon, small intestine, stomach, gallbladder, liver, and pancreas. Any previous surgery can create scar tissue in the abdomen making a laparoscopic procedure more technically difficult. The surgeon would decide if a laparoscopic approach is the best choice for you. Certain conditions or disease states lend themselves well to laparoscopic intervention.</p>
<p>In theÂ <strong>colon</strong>, the major indications for laparoscopic intervention are diverticulosis (see the ACG patient web page on diverticulosis), removal of large growths called polyps that are unable to be completely resected by colonoscopy, and colon cancer. The operation is typically performed by making four or five small abdominal incisions with the largest one being used to remove the specimen from the body. In general, these operations result in less blood loss during the surgery, less need for blood transfusions, and quicker time to eating a meal after surgery. Despite the accessibility of the colon by a laparoscope there has been much debate over the past decade regarding the safety of laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer. The main concern involves the possibility of spreading tumor cells to the surrounding tissue when the laparoscopic instrument contacts the tumor. Recent research presented at various national and international conferences by experienced laparoscopic surgeons indicates that laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer appears to be safe in expert hands.</p>
<p><br>
  TheÂ <strong>stomach</strong>Â is very accessible by the laparoscope. Repair of a perforated (ruptured) or bleeding peptic ulcer as well as removal of some stomach tumors can be performed laparoscopically. Another procedure that has received a lot of media attention is laparoscopic surgery for obesity or bariatric surgery, an operation designed to enable weight reduction. (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Gallbladder</strong>Â surgery is one of the most common operations performed in the United States, and lends itself well to the laparoscopic approach. The advent of laparoscopic gallbladder surgery has benefited many patients tremendously. In addition to not having to endure a cosmetically displeasing scar, patients can be quickly discharged from the hospital and return to their normal lifestyle within several days. This is in contrast to twenty to thirty years ago, when gallbladder surgery by the traditional open incision method routinely resulted in a 5 to 7 day hospital stay followed by several additional weeks of recovery time.</p>
<p>For conditions of theÂ <strong>small intestine</strong>, laparoscopic surgery may be performed to repair hernias, perforations (ruptures of the wall), and remove short segments of the intestine that contain tumors or focal areas of active inflammatory bowel disease. A hernia is a weakness in the muscle wall through which a portion of the small intestine can be trapped, causing pain and reducing the blood supply to the trapped tissue. Laparoscopic surgery of hernias provides the surgeon the opportunity to repair the weak muscle wall so the tissue cannot be trapped and allows earlier return to normal activities. Infections as can occur at the site of a ruptured diverticulum, or focal areas of inflammation as in Crohnâs disease can be treated laparoscopically.</p>
<p>The liver is a vascular (many blood vessels) organ that can bleed easily if cut, and until recently was not accessed laparoscopically. Indications for laparoscopic intervention of theÂ <strong>liver</strong>Â include drainage of cysts, abscesses, and biopsies of growths. Ablation (destruction by laser or chemical means) of some liver tumors can be performed laparoscopically. In recent years, skilled laparoscopic liver surgeons have performed segmental (partial) resections of the liver as well.</p>
<p>Laparoscopic surgery involving theÂ <strong>pancreas</strong>Â is usually a âstaging laparoscopyâ when there is concern for a cancer or benign (non-cancerous) tumor. During this procedure, the surgeon examines the entire abdomen for signs of tumor spread beyond the pancreas. Pancreatic tumors are often very tiny and may not be detected by x-rays. If a pancreatic tumor has spread far from the site of origin, surgical resection of the primary tumor cannot be done. In learning this information during the staging process, the patient is saved from undergoing a more extensive operation.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/laparoscopic-surgery/" class="faqquestion">What is anti-reflux surgery?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>One of the most important options for certain patients with chronic and severe gastroesophageal reflux disease is anti-reflux surgery. In normal individuals, reflux of acid from the stomach up into the esophagus is prevented by a barrier created by a ring of muscle in the lower esophagus called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). If the LES becomes weak, free reflux of acid can occur, resulting in inflammation and ulcerations in the esophagus. Chronic reflux may be associated with development of Barrettâs esophagus, a condition that has a small but real risk of esophageal cancer. Laparoscopic surgery can effectively reestablish this barrier in carefully selected individuals, resulting in control of symptoms long-term (in some studies, reported as high as 90%) and avoiding the need for chronic acid suppression medications. This operation, referred to as âfundoplicationâ, consists of wrapping the upper part of the stomach around the lower end of the esophagus.</p>
<p>Prior to the development of proton pump inhibitors, the most common indication for anti-reflux surgery was the inability to control GERD on medical therapy. However, this is rarely the case now with the use of proton pump inhibitors or high-dose H2 receptor antagonists. On the other hand, these drugs are expensive and generally require at least daily dosing for symptom control. Other indications for anti-reflux surgery include difficult to manage strictures, rare non-healing ulcers, severe bleeding from esophagitis and aspiration symptoms. The presence of Barrettâs esophagus alone is not an indication for anti-reflux surgery. Neither surgical nor medical series have consistently shown the regression or resolution of Barrettâs esophagus with effective acid suppression.</p>
<p>The menu for successful anti-reflux surgery is both simple and complex. The primary criteria are the right surgeon and the right patient. The surgeon should be experienced and skillful. The diagnosis of GERD must be well established prior to referral for surgery. All patients require a comprehensive evaluation of gastroesophageal function prior to operation. The minimal evaluation should include upper GI endoscopy, esophageal manometry, primarily to identify a weak esophageal pump and exclude achalasia or scleroderma, and 24-hour pH monitoring, especially in patients without esophagitis, selected patients may also require gastric emptying studies, if there are symptoms of nausea, vomiting, or bloating.</p>
<p>In summary, laparoscopic intervention may be an option in a wide variety of digestive disorders. At present, laparoscopic gallbladder surgery is readily available in most community hospitals. Some surgeries may require the skill of a surgeon who has completed advanced laparoscopy training, therefore, an understanding of a surgeons training and experience is recommended prior to the procedure. If at any time during a laparoscopic procedure the surgeon feels it important to view the entire abdomen they could remove the laparoscope and revert (change) to an open procedure. Obviously, this would only be done in the interest of patient safety and trying to assure the best outcome. You should consult with your doctor whether some type of laparoscopic surgery is most suitable for your needs.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-peg/" class="faqquestion">What is a PEG?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>A percutaneous endoscopic  gastrostomy (PEG) is a  procedure for placing a feeding tube directly into the stomach through a small incision in the abdominal  wall with the assistance of an instrument known as an endoscope. The  procedure is performed as a means of providing nutrition to patients who cannot  take food by mouth. Many stroke patients, for example, have poor control over their  swallowing muscles and are unable to safely consume enough food, or they have  muscle weakness that allows food to leak into the lungs when they swallow  things by mouth. Many of these patients will benefit from a PEG tube in order  to receive adequate nutrition and to prevent them from respiratory problems  that develop when food or fluids accidentally gets into the lungs.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-peg/" class="faqquestion">What are the medical indications for a  PEG?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>A PEG should be considered for  pediatric and adult patients who are unable to consume sufficient food by mouth  to meet their daily needs. These patients should be able to digest and absorb their food once it arrives in the stomach. The  most common medical conditions requiring a PEG feeding tube are neurologic  conditions associated with poor  swallowing, such as experienced by stroke patients, and patients with cancers  of the oral cavity or esophagus that prevent them from swallowing.  Other diseases of the esophagus that decrease a patientâs ability to swallow  are also common indications for  placing a PEG feeding tube. Patients with Alzheimerâs disease often lose their  ability to swallow near the end of their life expectancy. The benefit of PEG  tube placement in this patient group remains controversial. When a patient is  being considered for PEG tube  placement, the patientâs life expectancy and quality of life after the tube is  placed should be considered to determine if placement of a feeding tube is  appropriate.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-peg/" class="faqquestion">What is the medical procedure for  placing a PEG tube?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>PEG tubes are placed with the  aid of an endoscope, an instrument to see inside your stomach and intestines.  The patient receives sedatives and pain medications to make them comfortable. After confirming proper location and  preparing the abdominal wall, a small incision is made in the abdomen. The PEG  feeding tube is placed though this incision into the stomach. The procedure  takes 15 to 20 minutes. </p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-peg/" class="faqquestion">Is there discomfort after the procedure?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There will be some minimal discomfort  after the procedure from either cramping from gas in the digestive system or  pain at the incision site itself. This pain can be well controlled with pain  medication if required.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-peg/" class="faqquestion">Will the tube fall out once it is placed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The tube is prevented from  coming out of the stomach by one of several methods. Some commercial PEG brands  have a mushroom-shaped cap on the end of the feeding tube inside the stomach.  This cap is 2-3 times the diameter of the feeding tube. This cap is also called  the internal bolster or internal  bumper. Other systems employ a balloon at the end of the tube which is inflated  once the tube is inserted, serving the same purpose. These internal bolsters  prevent the PEG feeding tube from falling out.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-peg/" class="faqquestion">What does the PEG tube look like on the outside  after placement?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The PEG tube has a diameter  size about the same as a writing pen. Approximately 6 to 12 inches of tubing  will protrude from the incision area. There will be a disc or a tubular device  placed around the feeding tube lying against the abdominal wall. This is known  as the external bolster or external bumper. It is meant to keep the tube from  migrating forward into the stomach. At the outside end of the feeding tube is a  capped plug. It may be a one hole or two hole plug. The plug is meant to be  closed to prevent stomach content from getting on the skin and clothes of the  patient. It is opened to allow food, medications and water to be placed through  the PEG feeding tube. Suctioning of air and stomach contents can also be  performed.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-peg/" class="faqquestion">What are the complications of a PEG tube?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>  Complications  from this procedure may occur. Minor complications include leakage of food or  fluid around the tube onto the abdominal wall surface, pain at the incision  site, mild bleeding at the incision site or infection at the incision site. You  should consult with your doctor if this occurs. Major complications are rare  but can occur and include major bleeding, peritonitis (an infection inside the  abdominal cavity) and damage to the colon or other surrounding organs. Delayed  complications include âburied bumperâ syndrome in which the internal bolster  buries itself into the stomach wall. This can be avoided by not tightening the  bolster too tightly.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-peg/" class="faqquestion">Are there alternatives to PEG?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>  There are alternatives to PEG  feeding tubes. Nasogastric (NG) feeding tubes are tubes passed through the nose  into the stomach for feeding. It is  secured to the face with tape. Long-term use of these tubes can cause  irritation, infection or bleeding of  the nose and throat. These tubes also have a tendency to be accidentally pulled  out. Also, a surgeon can place a feeding tube into the stomach in the operating  room or a radiologist can place a  feeding tube into the stomach in the fluoroscopy  (X-Ray) suite. Similar procedures can be done to place feeding tubes into the  jejunum as well, depending on the clinical scenario.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-peg/" class="faqquestion">How do you take care of a PEG tube?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p> The  area around the incision on the abdominal wall should be cleaned daily and the  incision may be covered with clean gauze. Often, these gauze sponges have a  slit in them so they can be placed around the PEG tube, over the incision. The  tube itself has centimeter markings written on the side. The centimeter marking  at or near the incision site should  be noted. If this number changes, the tube should be readjusted back to the original centimeter marking. The external bolster  should rest gently near the abdominal wall. This external bolster should not be  placed too tightly against the abdominal wall or  it may lead to infection or skin  ulceration.</p>
<p>Should  the tube accidentally come out, it must be replaced within twenty-four hours or the incision may begin to close and new PEG  procedure may be required. If the tube falls out, a physician should be  contacted as soon as possible. A urinary (Foley) catheter can be temporarily  inserted into the track to keep it open until a standard PEG tube can be  replaced. If the tube needs removal or  replacement, it is usually wise to wait 6 or  more weeks after insertion before removal. Â </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-peg/" class="faqquestion">What  exact nutritional formula is placed through the PEG tube?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>  After  the PEG feeding tube is placed, a registered dietitian, nurse, pharmacist or  physician who specializes in nutrition should assess the patient to determine  their nutritional needs; this means the amount of calories, protein, and fluids  that will be necessary each day, as well as the most appropriate nutritional  formula. Nutritional products designed for tube feeding are formulated to  provide all the nutrients the patient will need including vitamins, and  minerals.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-peg/" class="faqquestion">How is a PEG tube used for feeding?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>  The PEG  tube is relatively narrow. Commercial tube feedings are available and are  designed to reduce the risk of tube clogging. The PEG tube should be flushed  with water before and after feedings, or after medications have been  administered. The placement of table foods into the PEG tube is discouraged as  it can lead to tube clogging. It is imperative that the caregiver or patient  thoroughly washes their hands with soap and water before preparing formula or  having contact with the PEG system. </p>
<p>The  commercial tube feeding formula is administered at room temperature. The  patient should be upright, no less than thirty degrees, to minimize the risk of  regurgitation and potential aspiration (tube feeding getting into the lungs).  The patient should be kept upright for thirty to sixty minutes after feeding.  To prevent complications (abdominal cramping, nausea and vomiting, bloating,  diarrhea, aspiration), tube feeding should be infused slowly.</p>
<p>The  simplest method of infusing tube feeding through the PEG tube is called bolus  feeding. Tube feed formula is placed within a large syringe and slowly  administered to the patient through the plug cap on the end of the PEG feeding  tube. In order to meet a patientâs nutritional needs, this may need to be  repeated 4 to 6 times per day. Sometimes continuous feeding is preferable. With  this method, a feeding pump is set up and connected to the PEG tube. The tube  feed formula is placed in a large bag and attached to the pump. The tube  feeding is continuously administered by the pump over 12-24 hours. </p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-peg/" class="faqquestion">Can I  put medications through a PEG tube?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Most medications that come in  tablet or pill form can be crushed and dissolved in water and passed through  the feeding tube. In addition, there may be liquid formulations of medications  that can be prescribed. However, some capsules are designed to dissolve within  various portions of the gastrointestinal tract and therefore cannot be broken  up. The tube should be flushed with water after introduction of medication to  prevent clogging. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about specific medications.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-peg/" class="faqquestion">Is a PEG tube permanent?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Depending on the medical  condition, a PEG feeding tube may be temporary or permanent. After a minor  stroke, for example, a patient may recover swallowing and ultimately be able to  get adequate calories and nutrients from eating by mouth. However, those with  more permanent neurologic damage may require a feeding tube long-term. In  either case, the feeding tube can be easily removed if necessary.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-peg/" class="faqquestion">Do PEG feeding tubes last forever?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>  The  lifespan of the PEG feeding tube is about 1 year although the tube may wear out  sooner. When the tubing begins to wear, you will notice pits, bumps and leaks on  the side of the tube. In addition, the feeding tube cap may split or fail to  close properly. You should notify your physician if this develops.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-peg/" class="faqquestion">How is a PEG  tube removed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>PEG tube removal should only  be done by a trained healthcare provider. If the brand of tube has a soft  internal mushroom bolster, it can be removed by pulling. This may cause some  transient stinging and burning at the incision site. If it has a balloon  internal bolster, the balloon is deflated and the tube is removed. There are also unique commercial PEG brands that require other methods of removal.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/sedation-for-endoscopy/" class="faqquestion">
What is sedation? Why do I need it for my endoscopy?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Sedation is a state of sleepiness that occurs when you receive medication to help you rest during a procedure, and is commonly given before an endoscopic procedure. When an endoscopy is performed, some air is instilled into the stomach or intestines, which could cause mild discomfort. Sedation is used to help relieve or avoid the sensation of discomfort. Different terms are used depending upon the specific medication being administered. The term âconscious sedationâ also referred to as moderate sedation, is used to refer to the most common combination of medications being administered, and is very adequate for the sedation needs of most patients having an endoscopy. A lesser percentage of patients may require, or may request what is called deep sedation, most commonly with a medication called propofol. This medication also is frequently used to administer general anesthesia for surgery. Propofol requires different patient monitoring during the procedure and, depending upon circumstances, may require anesthesia personnel, and so involve additional patient cost. Most of the time, the medicine is given through a vein.</p>
<p>Some patients have their endoscopic procedures done without sedation. If you are considering having endoscopy without sedation, discuss this with the staff or doctor on the day of the exam.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/sedation-for-endoscopy/" class="faqquestion">Is sedation safe?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Sedation is very safe for most people having an endoscopy. Complications associated with sedation are rare occuring in less than one in every 10,000 people. The most common complications involve a temporary decrease in the rate of breathing or heart rate. By far, the most common problem is a temporary decrease in the blood oxygen level that occurs when breathing slows or subjects are not taking deep breaths. This can be corrected by giving extra oxygen through a small nasal tube. If complications related to sedation occur, medicines can be given by vein that reverse the effects of the sedation medications.</p>
<p>Your doctor is trained in the use of sedation medications. Your blood pressure, pulse (number of times your heart beats every minute), and oxygen levels are checked regularly during an endoscopic procedure and while in the recovery area. This monitoring of your vital functions helps the staff and your doctor know how you are doing during and after medications are given and recognize any problems.</p>
<p>The physician or person administering the medication will need to know your history of drug allergies, all of your medications and doses (including over the counter therapies) and your medical history. Having this information handy when you come in for the endoscopy will help your doctor in planning what type and dose of sedation is right for you.</p>
<p><strong>Below is information that is important for you and your doctor to plan your endoscopy. Please feel free to print this checklist to give it to your doctor before the endoscopy:</strong></p>
<p>Please tell your doctor if you are taking medicine for any of the following conditions:</p>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Since the medicine can last longer than the endoscopy, it is required that you have a friend or family member take you home. As a rule of thumb, since the sedation medicine can affect your reaction time and your ability to make decisions for a few hours, you cannot drive and it is recommended that you do not go to work or make important decisions until the day after your endoscopy.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Gastroenterologists  often order radiographic tests to help diagnose diseases of the  gastrointestinal tract. Common complaints that may lead to such testing include  abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, blood in  the stool, bloating, weight loss, and abnormal laboratory tests. This chapter  describes the more commonly performed radiographic tests.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/gi-radiographic-tests/" class="faqquestion">
Abdominal X-ray</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>An  abdominal X-ray may be ordered to evaluate nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain,  to exclude a blockage, perforation, or paralysis of the intestinal tract. These  X-rays may be performed in the standing and flat positions. Organs absorb  different amounts of the radiation and this is seen on a film as varying  degrees of black, white, or gray. </p>
<h3>Barium Esophagram (Barium Swallow)</h3>
<p>Barium  studies, also called contrast studies, involve use of a liquid agent that when  swallowed provide an X-Ray image of the inside of the intestine in relation to  the wall of the organ and surrounding structures Barium is a thick, white  chalky substance. A barium esophagram, or barium swallow, may be ordered for  patients with difficult or painful swallowing, coughing, choking, a sensation  of something stuck in the throat, or chest pain. The test is performed when a  patient drinks the barium and X-ray images or a video is made. Sometimes you  are also asked to swallow a barium tablet if you have trouble swallowing. This  enables the doctor to detect a subtle narrowing in the esophagus called a  stricture.</p>
  <h3>Upper Gastrointestinal Series and Small  Bowel Follow Through X-ray</h3>
<p>An  upper gastrointestinal series is a barium study evaluating the esophagus,  stomach, and first part of the small intestine. This test is ordered to search  for causes of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or weight loss, to name a few.  It is performed much the same way as the barium esophagram, except additional  time is required to take pictures as the barium travels further in the  intestinal tract. A small bowel follow-through x-ray utilizes the same  principles and requires abdominal x-ray films to be taken over many hours. This  last test is often ordered to evaluate chronic diarrhea or abdominal pain, or  to follow patients with Crohnâs disease. </p>
  <h3>Barium Enema</h3>
<p>A  barium enema also requires the use of barium but in a different manner.  Patients must undergo a bowel-cleansing regimen (taken orally) to eliminate  residue from the colon. On the day of the exam, a small tube is inserted in the  rectum and barium contrast is introduced throughout the colon. X-ray films are  then made and the colon anatomy is visualized. Abnormal findings may include  colon cancer, polyps, intestinal inflammation, and structural abnormalities  such as areas of narrowing (strictures) or diverticulosis, which may explain  the patientâs symptoms. Barium enema can also be used for colorectal cancer  screening and in instances when a colonoscopy cannot be completed, to evaluate  the remainder of the colon.</p>
  <h3>Abdominal Ultrasound, Doppler  Ultrasound, and Doppler Mesenteric Ultrasound</h3>
<p>An  ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging test, which uses sound waves to create  images of organs. Normal and abnormal tissues and organs contain different  acoustic properties. When an abnormality is present, such as a gallbladder  stone or changes in the appearance and size of the liver, a characteristic  appearance is noted on the ultrasound. The test is performed with the placing  of an ultrasound probe onto the skin over the organ(s) of interest. An  abdominal ultrasound may evaluate the gallbladder, liver, bile ducts, pancreas,  kidneys, and the abdominal cavity. The addition of a continuous sound wave,  called âDoppler,â is done to evaluate blood flow in vessels, both arteries, and  veins. A Doppler ultrasound of the liver determines if the veins to and from  the liver are open and not narrowed or obstructed. A Doppler mesenteric  ultrasound evaluates the three main arteries that carry blood to the intestinal  tract for any narrowing or stenosis. </p>
  <h3>Computed Tomography (CT) Scan, Computed  Tomography (CT) Angiography or Venography, and Computed Tomography (CT)  Enterography</h3>
<p>A  computed tomography scan, or CT scan, results in multiple high-resolution  cross-sectional images, (high quality pictures of the body as if it were being  sliced across the middle) every 5-10 millimeters, which are created by movement  between the X-ray beam and the film. A computer then reconstructs the images.  This exam is usually done with oral contrast, which the patient consumes hours  before the exam, and intravenous contrast (such as iodine), which is  intravenously injected into the patient at the time of the exam.  Gastroenterologists may order this test to evaluate abdominal pain, to exclude  an abscess (an area of infection), and to evaluate organs such as the liver,  pancreas, small intestine and colon. CT angiography or CT venography are  specific CT scans that evaluate either abdominal arteries or veins,  respectively. These tests are ordered when a condition with low blood flow to  the intestinal tract is strongly suspected. CT enterography is a CT scan  performed with large volumes of oral contrast to evaluate the small intestine. This  is a particularly useful test in patients with known or suspected Crohnâs  disease. </p>
  <h3>Virtual Colonoscopy</h3>
<p>Virtual  colonoscopy, or more appropriately, virtual colonography, employs the  principles of computed tomography with image reconstruction to produce a 3-D or  âvirtualâ exam of the colon. This test has received much attention over the  last few years because it has been suggested as an additional option for colon  cancer screening. This test requires a bowel preparation, is performed without  sedation, carries some reported risks of radiation exposure and involves  introducing air into the bowel through the rectum which often produces patient  discomfort. If an abnormality is noted via a virtual colonoscopy, such as a  polyp or growth within the colon, a colonoscopy must then be done. At present,  the exam does not reliably detect small lesions in the colon. Some advocates of  this procedure maintain that the small polyps that are not usually detectable  via this technique may be left in the bowel without treatment, even if they are  cancerous or precancerous. This view is at odds with the more conservative  posture of gastroenterologists that all polyps pose a potential health risk,  and need to be detected and removed as early as possible. </p>
  <h3>Magnetic  Resonance Imaging (MRI), Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP),  and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)</h3>
<p>Magnetic  resonance imaging, or MRI, is a noninvasive technique that involves use of a high  magnetic field to produce high resolution images of the body in various directions.  A non-iodine contrast agent, usually gadolinium, is injected at the time of the  exam. This test is performed to evaluate intra-abdominal organs, such as the  liver or pancreas, for masses or cysts. When the bile and pancreas ducts are  examined with MRI, this test is called MRCP. The arteries that carry blood to  the intestinal tract may be examined with a specific MRI known as MRA, or MR  angiography. MR enterography is an MRI performed with large volumes of oral  contrast to evaluate the small intestine. This is a particularly useful test in  patients with known or suspected Crohnâs disease. MRIâs are being used more  commonly than ever before because they do not expose patients to radiation.</p>
  <h3>Gastric Emptying Study</h3>
<p>A  gastric emptying study is a nuclear imaging study done to evaluate the ability  of the stomach to empty. Delayed gastric emptying, or gastroparesis, may result  from a number of conditions, most commonly from diabetes mellitus. This may  result in nausea, vomiting, bloating, sensation of early fullness during  eating, or abdominal pain. The test is performed by administration of a meal  that contains small amounts of a substance usually technetium sulfur. Images  are taken of the stomach over time. Normally, within a set time, a certain  amount of gastric contents exits the stomach and empties into the small  intestine. This test demonstrates the amount of contents remaining in the  stomach, and if the amount is below the established cut-off values, delayed  stomach emptying is diagnosed.</p>
  <h3>Cholescintigraphy (HIDA Scan)</h3>
<p>Another  nuclear scan, cholescintigraphy, commonly known as a HIDA scan, evaluates the  function of the gall bladder. This test may be ordered to diagnose or exclude  acute or chronic inflammation of the gallbladder, obstruction of the bile ducts,  and the presence of a bile leak. Nuclear contrast is injected intravenously and  images are taken. Much like a gastric emptying study, if the amount of bile  emptied from the gall bladder is below the normal range, there may be a problem  with gallbladder function.</p>
  <h3>Positron Emission  Tomography (PET) Scan</h3>
<p>Positron emission tomography, commonly known as PET scan, is  a newer, noninvasive technique that is very sensitive in detecting gastrointestinal  cancer. This test is increasingly ordered for this purpose and may be ordered  with a CT scan. A chemical called 18-flurodeoxyglucose, or FGD, is administered  and tissues or areas containing cancer take up this chemical. This in turn  leads to positive areas of uptake on images that are captured on film. Â Often times, this test is ordered to evaluate  for distant spread of a tumor (metastasis). Examples of gastrointestinal tumors  for which this test may be ordered include esophageal, stomach, pancreas, and  colon, to name a few.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hemorrhoids-and-other-anal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">What is the rectum?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The rectum is the last few inches of the colon. The rectum is connected to the anal canal, which leads the fecal matter out of the body.  The opening is called the anus. Problems in this part of the body are common, but people are often embarrassed to seek help. Common symptoms may include bleeding, pain and itching. When symptoms are persistent, it is important to have an evaluation by a doctor.</p> 
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hemorrhoids-and-other-anal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">What are hemorrhoids?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Hemorrhoids are blood vessels (veins) in the rectum or anal canal.  When those blood vessels become swollen or dilated, symptoms may develop.  Many people have hemorrhoids, but have no symptoms.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hemorrhoids-and-other-anal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">How common are hemorrhoids?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Hemorrhoids are very common and by age 50, nearly half of Americans have hemorrhoids.  Nearly 5% of the US population (15,000,000 people) has sought medical care for symptomatic hemorrhoids.  Many more have problems with hemorrhoids, but never seek formal medical attention.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hemorrhoids-and-other-anal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">What are the different types of hemorrhoids?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p><em>External hemorrhoids</em> are dilated veins covered by the skin near the anal opening.  They may be felt as bumps or lumps near the outside of the anus, and become painful when they are swollen with blood.  They can sometimes be confused with skin tags which are extra pieces of skin near the anus</p>

<p><em>Internal hemorrhoids</em> are dilated veins that form inside the rectum and above the anal opening, and are therefore âinternalâ. However, in some situations they may enlarge and protrude (prolapse) out of the anus.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hemorrhoids-and-other-anal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of hemorrhoids?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>External hemorrhoids may be present and cause no symptoms. When they cause symptoms, the most common are pain or itching; they can often be felt as a bulge in the skin near the anal opening.  </p>
<p>Internal hemorrhoids may be present and cause no symptoms.  When they cause symptoms, the most common are painless rectal bleeding, which usually is seen as bright red blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet bowl.   It is important to know that just a few drops of blood in toilet water can change the color of the water dramatically. Other symptoms are itching, pain/soreness or feeling tissue come out when having a bowel movement.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hemorrhoids-and-other-anal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">How do hemorrhoids occur?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Hemorrhoids may develop as a result of repeated straining to have a bowel movement, sometimes as a result of longstanding constipation or diarrhea.  They are also seen commonly in any condition that leads to increased pressure inside the abdomen.  Common examples would include pregnancy and lifting heavy weights.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hemorrhoids-and-other-anal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">How are hemorrhoids diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Hemorrhoids are suspected when they produce the characteristic symptoms listed above.  External hemorrhoids may occasionally be seen on visual examination of the anus. A full exam usually includes a digital rectal exam, where the doctor will insert a gloved finger into the rectum. Internal hemorrhoids may be identified on external exam if they protrude with straining or may be detected during a check with a flexible or rigid tube with a light and a camera that is inserted in order for the doctor to see the inside of the anal canal and lower rectum.  Alternatively, your doctor may insert a small plastic speculum to exam the rectum. The speculum is called an anoscope and the flexible tube is a sigmoidoscope.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hemorrhoids-and-other-anal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">How are hemorrhoids treated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Most hemorrhoids resolve spontaneously, or with simple measures. These measures include avoidance of straining, and treatment of hard stools or constipation with increased fluids, addition of increased fiber in the diet or taken as fiber supplements and stool softeners or lubricants.  Soaking the affected area in a hot bath or using a sitz bath are also very effective. There are multiple over-the-counter creams and suppositories which can reduce symptoms of itching and pain.  When these are not effective, your doctor may prescribe a steroid cream or suppository to use for 1-2 weeks.  Some people find cleaning the anal region with a moist towel or "baby wipe" after a bowel movement to be soothing.  It is important to remember that hemorrhoids commonly recur with people and that you may have no symptoms in between episodes.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, hemorrhoids that do not resolve or bleed repeatedly need other type of treatment. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rubber band ligation: Small rubber bands are placed around the hemorrhoids, often in a doctorâs office.  This will cause the hemorrhoid(s) to fall off in several days and form a small ulcer where the hemorrhoid was.  This heals over time.  This is generally a painless procedure and minor discomfort resolves in 24 hours.  Using a pain reliever like Tylenol, Aspirin or Ibuprofen helps to remove discomfort after the procedure.  The procedure is safe and has become common for a gastroenterologist to do at an office visit.</li>
<li>Infrared coagulation:  A small probe is inserted in the rectum and heat is applied to destroy a hemorrhoid.  This should be mostly pain free.</li>
<li>Sclerotherapy: A chemical is injected directly into the hemorrhoid to help destroy the hemorrhoid tissue.</li>
<li>Surgery: Removal of the dilated, stretched veins.  This is performed by a general or colorectal surgeon in an operating room. </li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fissures </h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hemorrhoids-and-other-anal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">What is an anal fissure?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>An anal fissure is a tear in the lining of the anal canal.  It often occurs after the passage of a hard bowel movement.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hemorrhoids-and-other-anal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of an anal fissure?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>An anal fissure typically causes pain, especially with a bowel movement.  Sometimes, bleeding occurs as well. </p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hemorrhoids-and-other-anal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">How is an anal fissure diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>An anal fissure can be seen by a doctor on a visual exam of the anal region or can sometimes be felt by the doctor on an exam if it is not visible.  If the fissure is touched, it will usually be painful. Sometimes an anoscope (see above) is used to look inside the anal canal a very short distance to see how far the tear extends.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hemorrhoids-and-other-anal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">Can anal fissures be prevented?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Since anal fissures often result from the passage of hard bowel movements, keeping the stools soft and bulky (with fiber supplements) may help prevent them from occurring in the first place. </p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hemorrhoids-and-other-anal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">How are anal fissures treated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Most anal fissures will heal on their own within a few weeks if the stools are kept soft (possibly with stool softeners, and fiber supplements) and the area is not repeatedly re-injured.</p>
<p>Other measures may include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Sitz baths:  These will soothe the affected area with water</li>

<li>Medicated creams and/or suppositories to relieve pain and inflammation</li>

<li>Occasionally, the use of nitroglycerine or diltiazem ointment  applied to the area will be necessary</li>

<li>Occasionally, injection of botulinum toxin, BotoxÂ®, may be helpful </li>

<li>Surgery may be necessary if symptoms persist. The operation involves partially cutting a muscle that regulates the passage of stool out of the rectum. Cutting this muscle relieves pressure on the skin near the fissure, and allows the fissure to heal. </li>

</ul>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The rectum refers to the last four or five inches of the digestive tract.  The rectal outlet or opening is called the anal canal or anus.  Problems in this area are common, but many adults are too shy or embarrassed to ask their doctor about them.  Fortunately, most of these problems are treatable when recognized early and properly diagnosed.  Remember that symptoms of rectal pain or bleeding should always be thoroughly evaluated by your doctor.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What are hemorrhoids?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Hemorrhoids are veins in the anal canal that can become swollen or stretched. Just like varicose veins in the lower legs, hemorrhoids often cause no problems.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What are the different types of hemorrhoids?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There are two types of hemorrhoids:Â <em>external</em>Â andÂ <em>internal</em>.</p>
<p><em>External hemorrhoids:</em>Â are swollen veins that can be seen and often felt under the skin outside the anal canal. Usually they look like a small bulge and are the same color as the skin.</p>
<p><em>Internal hemorrhoids</em>Â are swollen veins that arise from inside the rectum.  When internal hemorrhoids become large, they may prolapse (stick out) through the anal canal.  The most common sign of hemorrhoids is bright red blood on toilet paper or drops of blood in the toilet bowel.  A thrombosed hemorrhoid contains a blood clot and may cause painful burning, pressure, or even an intense urge to scratch the area.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">How do hemorrhoids develop?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Hemorrhoids are very common.  About half the American population has hemorrhoids by the age of 50 years.  Hemorrhoids develop due to increased pressure often caused by straining to have a bowel movement. Hemorrhoids frequently develop in women during pregnancy when the developing fetus causes increased pressure on the rectal area.  Chronic constipation, diarrhea, genetic factors, and aging may also lead to hemorrhoids.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">How are hemorrhoids diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>As with all conditions involving the anal canal or rectum, the diagnosis is made by examining the anus visually and by performing a rectal examination (with a gloved finger).  Following this, a lighted instrument is inserted into the canal so that the inside of the rectum may be visualized.  This lighted tube may be an anoscope (a short tube which can examine the last few inches of the rectum) or a sigmoidoscope (a longer flexible tube that can also examine the lower part of the large intestine).</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">How are hemorrhoids medically treated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p><em>Eliminate constipation:</em>Â Bowel movements should be soft and should pass without need to strain. Constipation is usually caused by insufficient bulk in the bowel movement.  Increasing water intake, dietary fiber (see table below) and exercise are often effective remedies.</p>

<p><em>Creams and suppositories:</em>Â Preparation-H<sup>Â®</sup> or Anusol<sup>Â®</sup>.</p>
<p><em>Sitz baths:</em>Â Sit in a tub of warm water several times a day, then gently blot the anal area dry.</p>
<p><em>Gentle cleaning after a bowel movement:</em>Â For instance, cotton balls soaked in witch hazel, a moist wash cloth, or moist towelettes can be used.</p>
<p><em>Things to avoid:</em>Â irritating soaps, spicy foods and coffee.</p>

<h3>Endoscopic &amp; Surgical Treatment for Hemorrhoids</h3>

<p>When hemorrhoids bleed excessively or are very painful they can be treated with surgery.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Banding:</em>Â a rubber band is placed around the hemorrhoid and causes strangulation followed by scarring.</li>
<li><em>Sclerotherapy:</em>Â injection of a chemical solution into the hemorrhoid causing them to shrink.</li>
<li><em>Infrared coagulation:</em>Â a special device used to destroy the internal hemorrhoid.</li>
<li><em>Radiofrequency ablation:</em> a device that uses high-intensity sound waves to close off the hemorrhoids.</li>
<li><em>Hemorrhoidectomy:</em>Â surgical removal of hemorrhoid veins (commonly requires hospitalization).</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What is an anal fissure?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>This is a fairly common condition in which the lining of the anal canal becomes torn.  This generally produces pain or a burning sensation, especially with passage of a bowel movement. Bleeding may also occur.  A fissure usually occurs after the passage of a large, hard bowel movement.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">How is a fissure diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>When an anal fissure is present, a digital examination is usually painful.  The fissure can usually be visualized by external inspection of the anus, or a small scope (anoscope) can be used to determine the extent of the tear.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">How is an anal fissure treated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>The best treatment is prevention; ingestion of a high-fiber diet to promote bowel regularity is of utmost importance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sitz baths several times day</li>
<li>Stool softeners</li>
<li>Creams and/or suppositories (i.e., Preparation- H<sup>Â®</sup> or Anusol<sup>Â®</sup>)</li>
<li>Some doctors will recommend nitroglycerine ointment or injection of botulinum toxin (Botox<sup>Â®</sup>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most fissures will heal within several weeks, but surgery may be necessary if symptoms persist.  Surgery consists of cutting a portion of the anal sphincter muscle.  This reduces tension of the anal sphincter and promotes healing. Risks of surgery include loss of bowel control, or accidental incontinence of stool.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What is an anal abscess/fistula?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>An abscess is a cavity filled with pus.  This usually results from a blockage of the anal glands located just inside the anus.  A fistula is a connection or tunnel between the anal gland and the buttocks, usually very close to the anal opening.  An anal fistula is almost always the result of an anal abscess.  There are other problems, such as Crohnâs disease, which may be the underlying cause of the fistula.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of an anal abscess/fistula?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>An abscess produces considerable pain and swelling just adjacent to the anal opening.  Fever may also be present.  A fistula produces drainage from the anal canal to the opening of the fistula on the buttocks.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">How is a fistula treated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p><em>Medical Treatment:</em>Â When a fistula is caused by Crohnâs disease, your doctor may recommend treatment with medicines such as metronidazole azathioprine, or biological agents such as infliximab (Remicade<sup>Â®</sup>) or Adalimnunab (Humira<sup>Â®</sup>) or newer agents.</p>
<p><em>Surgical Treatment:</em>Â Generally, the sphincter muscle is cut to open the tunnel, thereby connecting the internal and external openings of the fistula.  A groove is formed, which then slowly heals and forms scar tissue.  During the healing process, stool softeners and Sitz baths are frequently recommended.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What is fecal incontinence?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Fecal incontinence is the accidental loss of stool.  Causes of fecal incontinence in adults include back trauma, sphincter disruption as a result of accidents, anorectal surgery, or obstetrical trauma, and medical illness such as multiple sclerosis and diabetes mellitus.  Many women have suffered nerve or muscle injury to the anal sphincter caused by forceps-assisted delivery, prolonged labor, or delivery of a large baby, and this can contribute to fecal incontinence.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">How is incontinence evaluated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>The doctor should look at the anorectal area to see if there are any changes, scarring, fissures or prolapse (protrusion) of the rectum.  A digital examination with the doctor inserting a finger into the rectum should be performed to determine if there is an impaction of stool, to assess muscle tone at rest and with squeeze effort, and to exclude a rectal mass.</p>
<p>Anal manometry is a specialized test that can measure the pressures generated by the anal sphincter muscles at rest and with maximal squeeze effort.  X-rays may identify physical abnormalities of muscle function.  This examination involves the placement of barium paste simulating stool into the rectum and asking the patient to defecate, strain or squeeze while taking x-ray pictures.  Ultrasound can be used to evaluate the muscles and other structures of the anal area.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">How is incontinence treated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Treatments for incontinence include dietary modification, medicines, biofeedback and surgery.  Avoid foods that promote production of gas, and foods containing ingredients such as lactose, fructose and sorbitol.  Fiber supplements can increase bulk and add form to the bowel movement and result in improved control.  Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles may improve anorectal control.  Loperamide or diphenoxylate HCl may decrease stool volume and frequency, improve stool consistency, or perhaps directly affect the sphincter muscles.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What is biofeedback?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Biofeedback is a conditioning technique.  Patients are taught how to work and strengthen the sphincter muscles.  For successful results, the patient must be motivated, have some degree of rectal sensation, and intact nerve and muscle function of the anal sphincter.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">Is surgery helpful?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Surgery is often considered as primary therapy if rectal prolapse is the cause of incontinence.  Obstetrical injuries, trauma and disruption of the sphincter are usually managed by primary repair of the defect.  Pre-operative testing of nerve and muscle function may help to identify those who may benefit from surgery.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What are the causes of rectal pain?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Rectal pain may result from structural conditions such as hemorrhoids, fissures, fistula or abscess.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What is levator syndrome?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>The levator syndrome presents with an aching rectal pain related to spasm of the pelvic floor muscles.  It is important for the doctor to evaluate the area to exclude inflammation or even an infectious problem.  The levator syndrome is more commonly seen in women.  The tenderness is often on the left side. Treatment consists of reassurance, application of heat, and local massage.  Electro-galvanic stimulation may break the spasm pain cycle by delivering a high voltage-pulsed current using a rectal probe. Biofeedback has also been suggested for some patients.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">Are there other causes of rectal pain which should be ruled out?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Another unusual cause of rectal pain isÂ <em>coccygodynia</em>Â (pain in the tail bone). This may be the result of traumatic arthritis or may even result from child birth.  This pain may be triggered by bowel movements.  Other rare causes of rectal pain include tumors of the spine, pelvis and rectum and endometriosis.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What is pruritus ani?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>This refers to itching around the anal area. It is often most troublesome at night or following a bowel movement.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/rectal-problems-in-women/" class="faqquestion">What causes pruritus ani?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Excessive cleaning or wiping of the anal area is common cause. Excessive sweating in the area around the anus is another cause. Certain beverages, including alcohol, citrus, and caffeine-containing drinks may aggravate the problem. Rarely, infectious and skin conditions can cause pruritus ani.Â <em>Poor hygiene is usually NOT the cause.</em>Â Unfortunately, when the problem develops, individuals often compound the problem by excessively washing and cleaning the anal area, only to aggravate the symptoms.</p>

<p>Avoid irritating soaps, especially those containing perfumes. Gently blot the area clean with a moist wash cloth, never excessively rub or scratch, and keep dry with powder. Eliminate irritating foods and beverages such as coffee, alcohol and spicy foods. Applying a paste consisting of zinc oxide and menthol can protect the perianal skin area and reduce itching.</p>

What is Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH)?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is the most common form of iron overload syndromes, i.e. diseases in which too much iron builds up in oneâs body. This extra iron is toxic to the body and can damage organs, lead to illness or even death.</p>
<p>There are three types of iron overload syndromes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) In this inherited disease, the genes that control the absorption of iron from the intestine are abnormal. This causes the intestine to absorb more iron than the body needs. This is the most common form of iron overload.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Secondary iron overload: In this condition, there is no genetic defect, but the intestine is stimulated to absorb more iron by other disorders. Examples of these disorders are anemias due to ineffective production and removal of red blood cells (thalassemia, aplastic anemia and sickle cell anemia) chronic liver disease and excessive intake of medicinal iron.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Parenteral iron overload: This occurs in patients who have received excessive amounts of iron either as blood transfusions or intravenous iron.</li>
</ol>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hereditary-hemochromatosis-hh/" class="faqquestion">What is the cause of HH?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>HH includes several genetic abnormalities, which cause the body to absorb excess iron from food. Since there is no way for the body to get rid of absorbed iron (other than bleeding or shedding of skin and intestinal cells), people with HH have to store the excess iron in cells of the liver, heart, pancreas, and other organs resulting in damage to these organs.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hereditary-hemochromatosis-hh/" class="faqquestion">Who gets HH?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The most common genetic abnormality in HH is an abnormality of theÂ <em>HFE</em>Â gene, which can be seen in about 90% of patients with HH. Inheritance is in an autosomal recessive pattern. Mutations in several other genes besidesÂ <em>HFE</em>Â are responsible for the remaining 10% of patients with HH.Â <em>HFE</em>related HH is one of the most common inherited disorders among Caucasians, with two copies of theÂ <em>HFE</em>Â gene mutation seen in about 1 in 250 persons in the general population.</p>
<p>A person who inherits the defective gene from both parents (someone who is homozygous) may develop HH. Studies indicate that about 60% of those who are homozygous for theÂ <em>HFE</em>Â defect develop increased iron levels, but only some develop complications as a result of this iron overload. People who inherit the defective gene from only one parent (someone who is heterozygous) are carriers for the disease but usually do not develop it, although they may have slightly increased iron levels.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hereditary-hemochromatosis-hh/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of HH?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Symptoms may begin anywhere from 30 years to 60 years of age, although in some rare cases they can occur as early as 20 years.</p>
<p>Many of the early symptoms of HH are nonspecific, including weakness and fatigue, impotence or decreased sex drive in men, early menopause in women and general muscle aches and abdominal pain. These symptoms can also be caused by a number of other medical problems unrelated to HH. With over 30 different symptoms associated with HH, the disease can be extremely difficult to diagnose. Women usually are protected from developing symptoms until after menopause as regular menstrual blood loss depletes just enough iron to keep the disease under control.</p>
<p>If untreated, or not diagnosed early enough, iron will continue to build up in the organs and can lead to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Diabetes</li>
  <li>Joint pain</li>
  <li>Abnormal heart rhythms</li>
  <li>Heart failure</li>
  <li>Cirrhosis of the liver, liver failure, or (rarely) liver cancer</li>
</ul>
<p>Many patients with advanced HH also have color changes in their skin giving it a bronzed appearance. This was one of the first clinical features recognized with this disorder, and is the origin of the name âhemochromatosisâ. This condition has also been called âbronze diabetesâ for the same reason.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hereditary-hemochromatosis-hh/" class="faqquestion">How is HH diagnosed?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Blood tests can determine whether the amount of iron stored in the body is too high. The tests commonly performed are transferrin saturation and ferritin.</p>
<p>The transferrin saturation test determines how much iron is held by the protein that carries iron in the blood. A fasting transferrin saturation of 45 percent or higher, on at least two occasions, is considered a sign of iron overload and further tests need to be performed to confirm the condition.</p>
<p>The serum ferritin test acts as an indirect measure of iron storage in the body. Serum ferritin levels are considered to be in the normal range for males and postmenopausal females if they are between 20 and 300 Î¼g/L. For premenopausal females, the normal range is between 20 and 200 Î¼g/L. People with advanced HH may have serum ferritin levels as high as 15,000 Î¼g/L. However, conditions other than HH can cause high serum ferritin levels, including liver disease, infection, cancer, heart disease, AIDS, metabolic disorders, and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis.</p>
<p>If either of these tests shows higher than normal levels of iron in the body, doctors can order a test called â<em>HFE</em>Â mutation analysisâ to detect the HFE gene mutations, which will confirm the diagnosis. The test â<em>HFE</em>Â mutation analysisâ determines mutations identified in the HFE gene. These are called C282Y and H63D. When patients have two copies of C282Y (one from each parent), they have HH. If they only have one copy of the C282Y, they are a carrier. Most patients with either one or two copies of the H63D mutation have no evidence of iron overload. If the mutation is not present, HH is not the reason for the iron buildup and the doctor will look for other causes.</p>
<p>Because HH is easily detected through tests for blood iron levels and by looking for mutations in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE), more doctors are diagnosing individuals with the disease before they have symptoms.</p>
<p>Doctors sometimes perform a liver biopsy in patients in order to determine the extent of liver damage and to distinguish between HH and other liver diseases. A liver biopsy is the only test that can tell whether cirrhosis is present, which is the only complication that affects the lifespan of someone with HH, since it increases the risk for liver cancer. A liver biopsy should be recommended for anyone with HH who has a ferritin level over 1000 Î¼g/L and/or abnormal liver function test results.</p>
<p>Outside of those two conditions (ferritin &gt; 1,000 Î¼g/L or elevated liver tests) the likelihood of cirrhosis is so low it does not usually justify the risk of the procedure (2% chance of minor complications such as transient pain/low blood pressure and &lt;0.1% chance of bleeding). A liver biopsy can also provide a clearer picture of the amount of iron that is being stored in the liver, which is known as hepatic iron concentration. Liver biopsy is also used in cases of apparent iron overload with a negative genetic test result and no other family history of HH.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hereditary-hemochromatosis-hh/" class="faqquestion">How is HH treated?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Treatment is simple, inexpensive, and safe. The first step is to rid the body of excess iron. This process is called phlebotomy, which means removing blood the same way it is drawn from donors at blood banks. Based on the severity of the iron overload, a pint of blood is taken once or twice a week for several months to a year, and occasionally longer. A phlebotomy of one unit of blood usually drops the ferritin level by about 30 Î¼g/L. Blood ferritin levels are tested periodically to monitor iron levels. The goal is to bring blood ferritin levels to the low end of normal and to keep them there. That means bringing the ferritin down to less than 50 Î¼g/L.</p>
<p>Once iron levels return to normal, maintenance therapy begins, which involves removing a pint of blood every 2 to 4 months for life. Some people may need phlebotomies more often. Many patients who are having maintenance phlebotomy do so as blood donors. An annual blood ferritin test will help determine how often blood should be removed. Regular follow-up with a specialist who has an interest in hemochromatosis or iron overload disorder is also necessary. This may be a hematologist or a gastroenterologist/hepatologist.</p>
<p>If treatment begins before organs are damaged, associated conditionsâsuch as liver disease, heart disease, arthritis, and diabetesâcan be prevented. The outlook for people who already have these conditions at diagnosis depends on the degree of organ damage. For example, treating HH can stop the progression of liver disease in its early stages, which leads to a normal life expectancy. However, if cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver, has developed, the personâs risk of developing liver cancer increases, even if iron stores are reduced to normal levels. People with diabetes resulting from damage to the pancreas usually see an improvement if not a reversal of their diabetes, depending on how much damage has occurred. Treatment cannot cure the conditions associated with established HH, but it will help most of them improve. The main exception is arthritis, which usually does not improve even after excess iron is removed.</p>
<p>People with HH should not take iron or vitamin C supplements. And those who have liver damage should not drink alcoholic beverages because they may further damage the liver or eat raw seafood because of a risk for a serious infection.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/hereditary-hemochromatosis-hh/" class="faqquestion">Who should receive screening and counseling for HH?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Screening for HHâtesting people who have no symptomsâis not a routine part of medical care or checkups. However siblings of patients who have HH should have their blood tested to see if they have the disease or if they are carriers. First degree relatives of patients who have the disease should be offered testing. Testing should include transferrin saturation, ferritin, andÂ <em>HFE</em>Â mutation analysis (gene test). When considering testing of children of a patient, it may be easier to test the other parent first and if he/she is negative for anyÂ <em>HFE</em>Â mutations, then the children can only be carriers. However, if the other parent has a gene mutation, then the children should be offered gene testing. Whenever genetic testing is done, a certified genetic counselor should be available and informed consent should be obtained.</p>
<p>Doctors should counsel patients to have their close relatives be tested and consider testing people who have joint disease, severe and continuing fatigue, heart disease, elevated liver enzymes, impotence, and diabetes because these conditions may result from HH.</p>
<p>Since the genetic defect is common and early detection and treatment are so effective, some researchers and education and advocacy groups have suggested that widespread screening for HH would be cost-effective and should be conducted. However, there are concerns about possible genetic discrimination that could come about by identifying someone who never is going to have any disease progression.</p>

			<wp:meta_key><![CDATA[_acg_gi_patients_cpt_basics_sectioncontent_1]]></wp:meta_key>
			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The esophagus  is a tube that connects the mouth and throat with the stomach ("food  pipe"). When a person swallows, the muscular wall of the esophagus  contracts to help push food down to the stomach. There are two main types of  cancer that can occur in the esophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma occurs more  commonly in the upper or middle part of the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma occurs in  the lower part of the esophagus.</p>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<p>Very small  tumors at an early stage do not generally cause symptoms. Patients commonly  experience difficulty swallowing as the tumor gets larger and the width of the  esophagus becomes narrowed. At first, most have trouble swallowing solid foods  such as meats, breads or raw vegetables. As the tumor grows, the esophagus  becomes more narrowed causing difficulty in swallowing even liquids. Cancer of  the esophagus can also cause symptoms of indigestion, heartburn, vomiting and  choking. Patients may also have coughing and hoarseness of the voice.  Involuntary weight loss is also common. </p>
<h3>Causes/Risk Factors</h3>
<p>Studies show  that esophageal cancer is more commonly diagnosed in people over the age of 55  years. Men are affected twice as commonly as women. Squamous cell esophageal  cancer is more common in African Americans than Caucasians. On the other hand,  adenocarcinoma appears to be more common in middle-aged Caucasian men.</p>
<p>The exact cause  is unknown; however, there are well-recognized risk factors. In the US, alcohol,  smoking and obesity are the major risk factors. Stopping drinking and smoking  may reduce the chance of getting esophageal cancer as well as other types of  cancers. Sometimes adenocarcinoma of the esophagus runs in families.</p>
<p>The risk of  cancer of the esophagus is also increased by irritation of the lining of the  esophagus. In patients with acid reflux, where contents from the stomach back  up into the esophagus, the cells that line the esophagus can change and begin  to resemble the cells of the intestine. This condition is knows as Barrett's  esophagus. Those with Barrett's esophagus have a higher risk of developing  esophageal cancer.</p>
<p>Less common  causes of irritation can also increase the chance of developing esophageal  cancer. For example, people who have swallowed caustic substances like lye can  have damage to the esophagus that increases the risk of developing esophageal  cancer.</p>
<h3>Screening/Diagnosis</h3>
<p>The doctor will  generally start by taking a complete history and performing a physical  examination. An esophagram, also called a barium swallow, is a series of x-rays  of the esophagus. The patient is asked to drink a barium solution, which coats  the inside of the esophagus. Multiple x-rays are then taken to look for changes  in the shape of the esophagus. </p>
<p>Most patients  undergo a test called endoscopy where a thin flexible lighted instrument with a  camera at the end is passed through the mouth into the esophagus. This scope  allows the doctor to see the inner layer of the esophagus. Biopsies can be  taken during this procedure if needed and submitted to the pathologist for  examination under a microscope to detect cancer cells.</p>
<p>A CT scan of  the neck, chest and abdomen may help to identify if there is any spread of the  cancer to other organs in the body so that the doctor can determine appropriate  management.</p>
<p>Endoscopic  ultrasound is a technique that can be used to provide detailed assessment of  the depth of the tumor and involvement of adjacent lymph nodes. This instrument  is similar to the endoscope above except there is ultrasound embedded at the  tip of the scope. Fine needle aspiration under ultrasound guidance can be  performed on any suspicious lymph nodes that are seen.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Depending on  the stage of esophageal cancer the patient may undergo surgery, radiation  and/or chemotherapy. Other measures that may improve symptoms include  stretching or dilation, tube prosthesis (stent) and radiation or laser  treatment to reduce the size of the cancer.</p>
<p>Doctors are actively looking at new ways of combining  various types of treatment to see if they may have a better effect on treating esophageal  cancer. Many patients with esophageal cancer undergo some form of combination  therapy with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Some patients with very early  cancer of the esophagus may undergo an endoscopic resection of the cancer  without surgery using techniques such as endoscopic mucosal resection or  endoscopic submucosal dissection.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

<p>The stomach is  part of the digestive system and connects the esophagus to the small intestine.  Once food enters the stomach the muscles in the stomach help to mix and mash  the food using a motion called peristalsis. Stomach cancer can develop in any  part of the stomach and can spread throughout the stomach and to other organs  such as the small intestines, lymph nodes, liver, pancreas and colon.</p>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<p>Patients may  not have any symptoms in the early stages and often the diagnosis is made after  the cancer has spread. The most common symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pain or discomfort in the abdomen </li>
  <li>Nausea and vomiting </li>
  <li>Loss of appetite </li>
  <li>Fatigue or weakness </li>
  <li>Bleeding (vomiting blood or passing blood in stools) </li>
  <li>Weight loss </li>
  <li>Early satiety (cannot eat a complete meal because of a âfull feelingâ)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Causes/Risk Factors</h3>
<p>No one knows  the exact reason why a person gets stomach cancer. Researchers have learned  that there are certain risk factors associated with the development of stomach  cancer. Those over the age of 55 years are more likely to get stomach cancer.  Men are affected twice as often as women and African Americans are affected  more commonly than Caucasians.</p>
<p>Stomach cancer  is more common in some parts of the world such as Japan, Korea, parts of  Eastern Europe and Latin America. Some studies do suggest that a type of  bacteria known as <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>, which can cause inflammation and ulcers  in the stomach, can be an important risk factor for developing gastric cancer.</p>
<p>Studies show  that people who have had stomach surgery or have a condition such as pernicious  anemia, or gastric atrophy (which result in lower than normal production of  digestive juices) can be associated with an increased risk of developing  gastric cancer.</p>
<p>There is also  some evidence that smoking increases the risk of developing gastric cancer.</p>
<h3>Screening/Diagnosis</h3>
<p>In addition to  taking a complete history and performing a physical exam, your doctor may do  one or more of the following tests:</p>
<p><u>Upper GI series</u> â The patient is asked to drink a barium solution. Subsequently x-rays of the  stomach are taken. The barium outlines the inside of the stomach helping to  reveal any abnormal areas that may be involved with cancer. This test is used  less often than it used to be, and patients now often undergo endoscopy (see  below) first.</p>
<p><u>Endoscopy</u> â A lighted, flexible tube with a camera, called an endoscope, is inserted  through the mouth into the esophagus and then into the stomach. Sedation is  given prior to insertion of the endoscope. If an abnormal area is found,  biopsies (tissue samples) can be taken and examined under a microscope to look  for cancer cells.</p>
<p>If cancer is  found, the doctor may schedule additional staging tests to determine if the  cancer has spread. A CT scan may be used to determine if cancer has spread to  the liver, pancreas, lungs or other organs near the stomach.</p>
<p>Staging of  gastric cancer may also be performed by using endoscopic ultrasound. Endoscopic  ultrasound can help to determine the depth of spread of the tumor into the wall  of the stomach and involvement of adjacent structures as well as assess for any  enlarged lymph nodes that may be invaded with cancer cells.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatment plans  may vary depending on the size, location, extent of tumor and the patient's  overall health. Treatments include surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation  therapy.</p>
<p>Surgery is the  most common treatment. The surgeon can remove part of the stomach (gastrectomy)  or the entire stomach. Lymph nodes near the tumor are generally removed during  surgery so that they can be checked for cancer cells. </p>
<p>Researchers are  exploring the use of chemotherapy before surgery to help shrink the tumor and  after surgery to help kill residual tumor cells. Chemotherapy is given in  cycles with intervals of several weeks depending on the drugs used. </p>
<p>Radiation  therapy is the use of high-energy rays to damage cancer cells and stop them  from growing. Radiation destroys the cancer cells only in the treated area.</p>
<p>Some patients  with very early cancer of the stomach that is involving only the superficial  layers of the stomach wall, may undergo an endoscopic resection of the cancer  without surgery using techniques such as endoscopic mucosal resection or  endoscopic submucosal dissection. </p>
<p>Doctors are looking at the combination of surgery,  chemotherapy and radiation therapy to see what combination would have the most  beneficial effect.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The liver is one of the largest organs in the body, located in the upper right portion of the abdomen. The liver has many important functions, including clearing toxins from the blood, metabolizing drugs, making blood proteins, and making bile which assists digestion. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a cancer that arises in the liver. It is also known as hepatoma or primary liver cancer. HCC is the fifth most common cancer in the world. Recent data shows that HCC is becoming more common in the US. This rise is thought to be because of chronic hepatitis C, an infection that can cause HCC. In the United States, most cancers that are found in the liver are ones that spread or metastasize from other organs. These cancers are not HCC, as HCC cancers begin in the cells of the liver. Cancers that commonly metastasize to the liver include colon, pancreatic, lung and breast cancer.</p>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<p>Abdominal pain  is the most common symptom of HCC and usually is present when the tumor is very  large or has spread. Unexplained weight loss or unexplained fevers are warning  signs in patients with cirrhosis. Sudden appearance of abdominal swelling  (ascites), yellow discoloration of the eyes and skin (jaundice), or muscle  wasting suggests the possibility of HCC.</p>
<h3>Causes/Risk Factors</h3>
<p>It is well  established that individuals with the hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus  infection are at increased risk of developing HCC. Alcohol related liver  disease is also a risk factor for the development of HCC. </p>
<p>There are  certain chemicals that are associated with liver cancer-aflatoxin B1, vinyl  chloride and thorotrast. Aflatoxin is the product of a mold called Aspergillus  flavus and is found in foods such as peanuts, rice, soybeans, corn and wheat.  Also thorotrast is no longer used for radiologic tests, and vinyl chloride, is  a compound found in plastics.</p>
<p>Hemochromatosis,  a condition in which there is abnormal iron metabolism, is strongly associated  with liver cancer. </p>
<p>Individuals  with cirrhosis from any cause such as the hepatitis virus, hemochromatosis and  alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency are at increased risk of developing HCC.</p>
<h3>Screening/Diagnosis</h3>
<p>The diagnosis  of HCC cannot be made by routine blood tests. Screening by a blood test for the  tumor marker, alpha- fetoprotein (AFP), and radiological imaging must be  performed. Some doctors advocate measurement of AFP and imaging every 6- 12 months in patients with cirrhosis in an effort to detect small HCC. Sixty  percent of patients with HCC will have an elevated AFP level and the remainder  may have normal AFP. Therefore, a normal AFP level does not exclude HCC.</p>
<p>Radiological  imaging studies are very important and may include one or more of the  following-ultrasound, CT scan (MRI magnetic resonance imaging) and angiography.</p>
<p><u>Ultrasound  examination</u> of the liver is frequently the initial  study if HCC is suspected.</p>
<p><u>CT scan</u> is a very common study used in the USA for the workup of liver tumors. The  ideal study is multi-phase CT scan with the use of oral and IV contrast. </p>
<p><u>MRI</u> can provide sectional views of the body in different planes. MRI can actually  reconstruct images of the biliary tree and the arteries and veins of the liver. </p>
<p>Angiography is  a study where contrast material is injected into a large artery in the groin.  X-ray pictures are then taken to evaluate the arterial blood supply to the  liver. If the patient has HCC, a characteristic pattern is seen because of the  newly formed abnormal small blood vessels that feed the tumor.</p>
<p>Biopsy may not  be needed in patients with a risk factor for HCC and elevated AFP. Biopsy can  be performed if there is some question as to the diagnosis of HCC or if the  doctor feels the management may be changed by the biopsy results.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>The prognosis  depends on the stage of the tumor and the severity of the associated liver  disease. There are some factors that predict poor outcome. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Demographics: male gender, older age, alcohol consumption </li>
  <li>Symptoms: weight loss, decreased appetite </li>
  <li>Signs of impaired liver function: jaundice, ascites or mental confusion related to liver disease       (encephalopathy) </li>
  <li>Blood tests: elevated liver tests, low       albumin, high AFP, low sodium, high blood urea nitrogen </li>
  <li>Staging of tumor: tumor over 3 cm,       multiple tumors, tumor invasion of local blood vessels, tumor spread       outside of liver.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Chemotherapy:</em><br />
  This may  include injection of anti-cancer chemicals into the body through a vein or  through chemoembolization. </p>
<p>The technique  of chemoembolization is a procedure where chemotherapeutic drugs are given  directly into the blood vessels that supply the tumor and small blood vessels  are blocked so that the drug stays within the area of the tumor. Chemotherapy  can provide some relief of symptoms and possibly decrease tumor size (in 50% of  patients) but it is not curative.</p>
<p><em>Ablation:</em><br />
Ablation  (tissue destruction) therapy in the form of using radiofrequency waves, alcohol  injection into the tumor or proton beam radiation to the tumor site are other  options for treatment. There is no data to indicate that any one of these treatment  is better than another. </p>
<p><em>Surgery: </em><br />
  Surgery is only  available to patients with excellent liver function who have tumors less than  3-5 cm that are confined to the liver. If the patient is able to undergo  surgery successfully, the five year survival is 30-40%. Many patients may have  recurrence of HCC in another part of the liver.</p>
<p><em>Liver  Transplantation:</em><br>
Liver transplantation is a treatment option for  patients with end-stage liver disease and small HCC. There is however a severe  shortage of donors in the USA. </p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The pancreas  makes pancreatic juices, which help digest food in the small intestines, and  hormones, including insulin. It is located behind the stomach in the back of  the abdomen. The duct of the pancreatic gland opens into the first portion of  the small intestine (called the duodenum) through a nipple like opening called  the ampulla.</p>
<h3>Symptoms </h3>
<p>Early  pancreatic cancer usually does not cause symptoms and is therefore known as the  "silent" disease. As the tumor gets larger, the patient may have one  or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Jaundice</strong> â If the tumor blocks the bile ducts (the       major bile duct passes through the pancreas), the patient may develop       jaundice, a condition where the skin and eyes may become yellow and the       urine may become dark in color. </li>
  <li><strong>Abdominal pain</strong> â As the cancer grows, the patient may       have pain in the abdomen which may radiate to the back. Pain may increase       with eating or lying down. </li>
  <li><strong>Nausea</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Decreased appetite</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Weight loss</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Causes/Risk  Factors</h3>
<p>It is not known  exactly why certain people get pancreatic cancer. Research shows that there are  certain risk factors that increase the chance of getting pancreatic cancer. Smoking is a risk factor. Alcohol consumption, a diet rich in animal fat and  chronic pancreatitis may also be risk factors. People with a condition called  hereditary pancreatitis are also at increased risk for getting pancreatic  cancer. Family history of pancreatic cancer is also an important risk factor as  are certain inherited and genetic conditions.</p>
<h3>Screening/Diagnosis</h3>
<p>In addition to  taking a complete history and performing a physical examination, the doctor may  perform certain endoscopic and radiologic tests such as a CT scan, MRI or  ultrasound. Endoscopic ultrasound may also be performed. This test may help in  finding small tumors that may be less than 2-3 cms (one inch). A biopsy of an  abnormal area of the pancreas may be performed in certain cases by inserting a  needle into the pancreas under ultrasonic guidance.</p>
<p>ERCP  (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram), a special x-ray study of the  pancreatic duct and the common bile duct may also be used to make the  diagnosis. For this test, a flexible tube with a light and a camera at the end  is passed through the mouth into the stomach and then the small intestines. Sedation is given. A dye is then injected into the pancreatic duct and the bile  duct to look for abnormal filling or obstruction of these ducts by the tumor.  During this procedure, biopsies can be taken using a brush that is inserted  into the bile duct. The biopsy specimens are then examined under a microscope  to look for cancer cells. </p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Cancer of the  pancreas is really only curable if it is found in the early stages. Surgery,  radiation and chemotherapy are possible treatment options. Surgery may be done  to remove all or part of the pancreas and surrounding tissues if needed.  Radiation therapy can be used to damage the cancer cells and prevent them from  growing. Radiation maybe used in certain trials after surgery to help kill any  remaining cancer cells. Chemotherapy will not cure pancreatic cancer but may  have some effect on slowing the rate of progression of the tumor or to improve  the patient's quality of life. Many new drugs are being investigated for  chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer and patients with this disease may have an  opportunity to participate in one of the research trials for chemotherapeutic  treatment of pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>Pain control may be a difficult problem in patients  with pancreatic cancer. Oral pain medication may be used, or patients may be  referred for a nerve block which is performed by injecting alcohol into the  bundle of nerves (celiac plexus) near the pancreas to decrease pain signals  from the pancreatic cancer to the brain.</p>

What is the esophagus?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The esophagus is a tube that connects the mouth and throat with the stomach ("food pipe"). When a person swallows, the muscular wall of the esophagus contracts to help push food down to the stomach. There are two main types of cancer that can occur in the esophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma occurs more commonly in the upper or middle part of the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma occurs in the lower part of the esophagus.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/esophageal-cancer/" class="faqquestion">Who gets esophageal cancer?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Studies show that esophageal cancer is more commonly diagnosed in people over the age of 55 years. Men are affected twice as commonly as women. Squamous cell esophageal cancer is more common in African Americans than Caucasians. On the other hand, adenocarcinoma appears to be more common in middle-aged Caucasian men.</p>

<p>The exact cause is unknown; however there are well-recognized risk factors. In the US, alcohol, smoking and obesity are the major risk factors. Stopping drinking and smoking may reduce the chance of getting esophageal cancer as well as other types of cancers. Sometimes adenocarcinoma of the esophagus runs in families.</p>

<p>The risk of cancer of the esophagus is also increased by irritation of the lining of the esophagus. In patients with acid reflux, where contents from the stomach back up into the esophagus, the cells that line the esophagus can change and begin to resemble the cells of the intestine. This condition is knows as Barrett's esophagus. Those with Barrett's esophagus have a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer.</p>

<p>Less common causes of irritation can also increase the chance of developing esophageal cancer. For example, people who have swallowed caustic substances like lye can have damage to the esophagus that increases the risk of developing esophageal cancer.</p></div>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Very small tumors at an early stage do not generally cause symptoms. Patients commonly experience difficulty swallowing as the tumor gets larger and the width of the esophagus becomes narrowed. At first, most have trouble swallowing solid foods such as meats, breads or raw vegetables. As the tumor grows, the esophagus becomes more narrowed causing difficulty in swallowing even liquids. Cancer of the esophagus can also cause symptoms of indigestion, heartburn, vomiting and choking. Patients may also have coughing and hoarseness of the voice. Involuntary weight loss is also common.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/esophageal-cancer/" class="faqquestion">How is esophageal cancer diagnosed?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The doctor will generally start by taking a complete history and performing a physical examination. An esophagram, also called a barium swallow, is a series of x-rays of the esophagus. The patient is asked to drink a barium solution, which coats the inside of the esophagus. Multiple x-rays are then taken to look for changes in the shape of the esophagus.</p>

<p>Most patients undergo a test called endoscopy where a thin flexible lighted instrument with a camera at the end is passed through the mouth into the esophagus. This scope allows the doctor to see the inner layer of the esophagus. Biopsies can be taken during this procedure if needed and submitted to the pathologist for examination under a microscope to detect cancer cells.</p>

<p>A CT scan of the neck, chest and abdomen may help to identify if there is any spread of the cancer to other organs in the body so that the doctor can determine appropriate management.</p>

<p>Endoscopic ultrasound is a newer technique that can be used to provide detailed assessment of the depth of the tumor and involvement of adjacent lymph nodes. This instrument is similar to the endoscope above except there is ultrasound embedded at the tip of the scope.</p></div>

Other measures that may improve symptoms include stretching or dilation, tube prosthesis (stent) and radiation or laser treatment to reduce the size of the cancer.</p>

<p>Doctors are actively looking at new ways of combining various types of treatment to see if they may have a better effect on treating esophageal cancer. Many patients with esophageal cancer undergo some form of combination therapy with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/liver-cirrhosis/" class="faqquestion">What is liver cirrhosis?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">

<p>Cirrhosis of the liver refers to scarring of the liver which  results in abnormal liver function as a consequence of chronic (long-term)  liver injury. Cirrhosis is a leading cause of illness and death in the United States.  In the United States,  approximately 5.5 million people (2% of the U.S. population) are affected by  cirrhosis. Cirrhosis causes 26,000 deaths each year and is the seventh leading  cause of death in the United    States among adults between the ages of 25  and 64. It is expected that the number of people affected by cirrhosis will  continue to increase in the near future.</p>
<p>The liver is the largest internal organ and is involved in  many complex metabolic functions essential to life. Blood leaving the digestive  system (stomach, intestines) passes through the liver on its way back to the  heart. Essential functions of the liver include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The liver extracts nutrients absorbed by the digestive system from the blood       and processes them for later use. </li>
  <li>The liver makes bile, which is delivered to the digestive system to help       absorb fat and certain vitamins.</li>
  <li>The liver also removes medications and toxic waste-products from the blood and       excretes them into bile.</li>
  <li>The liver is the bodyâs main factory for blood proteins, including the       proteins involved in normal blood clotting function. </li>
</ul>
<p>Cirrhosis of the liver is a consequence of long-term liver  injury of many types. While excess alcohol use and chronic infection with  hepatitis viruses (such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C) are the most common  causes of cirrhosis in the United States, cirrhosis can be caused by many  conditions including fatty liver disease, inherited disorders, drug-induced  injury, bile duct disorders and autoimmune diseases. Some patients may have  more than one cause for cirrhosis (such as alcohol excess and viral hepatitis).  A large portion of patients (up to 20%) do not have an identifiable cause for  cirrhosis. This is known as <em>cryptogenic  cirrhosis.</em></p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/liver-cirrhosis/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of liver cirrhosis?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The signs and symptoms of liver cirrhosis may be absent or non-specific at  early stages. Early non-specific symptoms include fatigue and itching. As scar  tissue replaces healthy tissue and liver function worsens, a variety of  liver-related symptoms may develop. </p>
<p>Since the liver performs many complex metabolic functions,  there are many possible complications that can develop due to cirrhosis. In  addition, some complications arise more commonly in certain diseases that cause  cirrhosis (for example, osteoporosis occurs more commonly in patients with  liver diseases that predominantly affect the bile ducts). </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><em>Fatigue: </em>Fatigue is a common       symptom of cirrhosis. Many patients with cirrhosis also develop loss of       muscle mass which can worsen fatigue. Fatigue due to cirrhosis can be       difficult to treat and it is important to seek out other treatable causes       of fatigue may be not be directly related to liver disease (such as       anemia).</li>
  <li><em>Itching:</em> Itching (also called <em>pruritus</em>) is a common symptom of       cirrhosis. Itching is most common in patients with cirrhosis due to bile       duct disorders, but itching can occur in any type of liver disease. Patients       with itching due to liver disease typically have itching over large parts       of their body and the itching can be severe. A variety of medications can       be used to treat cirrhosis-related itching.</li>
  <li><em>Edema</em> is the retention of abnormal       amounts of fluid in the body, most frequently in the legs. </li>
  <li><em>Ascites:</em> Ascites is the retention       of abnormal amounts of fluid inside the abdominal cavity (belly). When       ascites is mild it may be detectable only by ultrasound or CT scan. As the       amount of ascites increases, patients develop increasing abdominal size       and fullness, decreased appetite and abdominal discomfort. When large       amounts of ascites is present, the fluid restricts the normal expansion of       the chest during breathing and can lead to shortness of breath. In       addition, ascites fluid can become infected, a condition known as <em>spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. </em>Symptoms       of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis include fever and abdominal pain, but       often symptoms may be mild or absent. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is       a serious condition frequently requiring hospitalization and treatment       with antibiotics, usually given intravenously.</li>
  <li><em>Digestive Tract Bleeding:</em> Â Patients with cirrhosis can develop       abnormally enlarged veins (similar to varicose veins in the legs)called <em>varices </em>inside the digestive system. The most common place for       these to occur is in the lower part of the esophagus. Your doctor may       recommend an upper endoscopy (also known as an EGD) to see if varices are       present. Since the walls of the abnormally enlarged veins are thin,       varices can rupture and bleed into the digestive tract. Varices typically       do not cause symptoms unless they rupture and bleed. Bleeding varices can       be identified by the vomiting of blood or coffee-ground-like material or       the passage of maroon or black, tarry stools. Bleeding from esophageal       varices is a medical emergency and requires emergency treatment in your       nearest hospital.</li>
  <li><em>Jaundice</em> is a yellow discoloration       of the skin and whites of the eyes. Darkening of the urine (iced-tea or       cola colored) and/or pale (putty-colored) stools often occurs before the       yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes develops.</li>
  <li><em>Hepatic Encephalopathy: </em>In       cirrhosis, the normal filtering function of the liver is impaired and the       blood returning from the intestines is not properly detoxified of waste       products from digestion. When these waste products enter the circulation       they are delivered to the brain and a condition called hepatic       encephalopathy [pronounced: en-SEF-a-lo-path-e] develops. Symptoms of       hepatic encephalopathy include mental slowing, confusion, excess       drowsiness, and slurring of speech. In severe cases, patients can develop       coma. Your doctor may examine you looking for a certain type tremor that       can be a clue to the presence of encephalopathy. Your doctor may also       check your blood to measure your ammonia level, one of the toxins that is       found in increased amounts in the circulation of patients with       encephalopathy.</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/liver-cirrhosis/" class="faqquestion">What causes liver cirrhosis?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There are many causes of liver injury such as excessive  alcohol consumption, viruses, inherited disorders, drug-related injury and  environmental toxin exposure. Left untreated, any disease that causes on-going  (chronic) liver injury can lead to cirrhosis. Injury to the liver leads to  inflammation which may be detected by abnormalities in liver-related blood  tests. Over time, ongoing injury leads to the development of scar tissue in the  liver, a process called <em>fibrosis</em>. Since  the liver has a substantial amount of reserve function, mild to moderate  amounts of fibrosis usually do not lead to symptoms. However, as the amount of  fibrosis increases it can lead to disruptions in the normal shape and function  of the liver.</p>
<p>Cirrhosis occurs when the normal structure of the liver is  disrupted by bands of scar tissue. One of the normal functions of the liver is  to filter blood returning to the heart from the digestive system. When  cirrhosis is present, the presence of scar tissue causes increased resistance  to blood flow through the liver. This results in high pressures developing in  the veins that drain into the liver, a process called <em>portal hypertension.</em> Many of the complications of liver disease,  such as fluid retention and esophageal bleeding, are caused by the presence of  portal hypertension. </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/liver-cirrhosis/" class="faqquestion">What are the risk factors of liver cirrhosis?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There are several known risk factors for developing  cirrhosis. The most common risk factors are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Excess       alcohol use â regular consumption of more than 1-2 alcoholic beverage a       day for women or 2-3 alcoholic beverages a day for men over a long period       of time can lead to liver cirrhosis. Patients with other risk factors for       liver disease may develop cirrhosis with even less regular alcohol use.</li>
  <li>Infection       with viral hepatitis â while not all patients who have chronic infection       with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or the hepatitis C virus (HCV) will       develop cirrhosis, chronic viral hepatitis is one of the leading causes of       liver disease in the world.</li>
  <li>Obesity       and Diabetes â obesity and diabetes are both risk factors for a form of       liver injury known as <em>non-alcoholic       steatohepatitis </em>(NASH). Over time NASH can lead to significant liver       injury and cirrhosis. Not all patients with obesity or diabetes will       develop NASH, but given the obesity epidemic in the United States,       NASH is predicted to become the leading cause of cirrhosis in the future       (as the number of cases of viral hepatitis declines).</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/liver-cirrhosis/" class="faqquestion">How is liver cirrhosis diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Cirrhosis is best determined by examining a sample of liver  tissue under the microscope, a procedure which is called a <em>liver biopsy</em>. Â In this  relatively simple procedure a thin needle is inserted, usually under local  anesthesia, into the liver and removes a small piece of liver tissue. Â Liver biopsy not only confirms the presence of  cirrhosis, but can often provide information as to its cause. </p>
<p>A liver biopsy is not always necessary to diagnose cirrhosis.  Frequently, your physician may be able to diagnose cirrhosis by the presence of  changes noted during physical examination (such as enlargement of the spleen,  enlargement of the breast tissue in men, and certain skin findings) together  with the results from blood tests, imaging studies (such as ultrasound, CT or  MRI scans) and/or endoscopy. Â There are  several new tests that use ultrasound or MRI to directly measure the stiffness  of the liver which may help in diagnosing cirrhosis but these tests are not  widely available.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/liver-cirrhosis/" class="faqquestion">How is liver cirrhosis treated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Medical care for patients with cirrhosis has several aims:  (1) treating the underlying cause of liver disease when possible, (2)  preventing cirrhosis-related complications, and (3) treating the symptoms of  cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is a chronic disease, and patients with cirrhosis require  ongoing medical care with a physician specializing in the care of patients with  liver disease (a <em>gastroenterologist </em>or<em> hepatologist). </em></p>
<p>Whenever possible, the underlying cause of cirrhosis should  be treated. Some conditions improve with medial therapy and treatment can  improve or delay worsening of liver function. In some circumstances, patients  may not tolerate treatments for their underlying liver disease because their  cirrhosis is too advanced. </p>
<p>Patients with cirrhosis should not drink alcohol. In  patients who consume alcohol regularly, liver function may improve  significantly with total avoidance of alcohol.</p>
<p>Your doctor may recommend various treatments aimed at  preventing complications of cirrhosis from developing. Infection is an  important cause of illness in patients with cirrhosis and your doctor may  recommend updating your vaccinations. Typically, patients with cirrhosis should  receive a yearly flu (influenza) vaccine and the pneumonia (pneumococcal)  vaccine. Your doctor may test you for hepatitis A and hepatitis B and vaccinate  you if you are not immune. </p>
<p>Patients with cirrhosis are at increased risk of developing  primary liver cancer, known as hepatocellular carcinoma. The risk for liver  cancer varies according to the underlying liver disease, but in patients with  hepatitis C infection (one of the most common causes of liver disease in the United States)  it is approximately 3-4% each year. Successful treatment for liver cancer  depends on early detection. Liver cancers frequently do not cause any symptoms  when they are small and treatment options may be limited by the time symptoms  develop. Your doctor may recommend an ultrasound, CT scan or MRI of your liver  at a regular interval, typically every 6 months, to detect liver tumors. A  blood test called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) may also be used to help detect  tumors, however, it is not reliable enough by itself to replace the need for  periodic imaging testing.</p>
<p>Your doctor may prescribe various treatments to help control  symptoms from complications of cirrhosis. These may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dietary salt restriction and diuretic  medications (commonly known as âwater pillsâ) are prescribed for the control of  ascites and edema. In some cases, a small needle may be inserted into the  abdominal cavity under local anesthesia to drain ascites fluid, a procedure  known as a <em>paracentesis.</em></li>
  <li>Patients with ascites who have experienced prior  episodes of infection in the fluid (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) or who  have a high risk of infection (based on laboratory analysis of the fluid) are  given long-term oral antibiotic medication to prevent future episodes of  infection.</li>
  <li>Various medications may be prescribed for  patients with hepatic encephalopathy. These include lactulose and/or certain  types of oral antibiotics. </li>
  <li>Patients with esophageal varices may be treated  with blood-pressure reducing medications or treatment may be applied directly  to the varices during an endoscopy. </li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases your doctor may recommend the insertion of a <em>TIPS shunt. </em>The placement of a TIPS  shunt is an invasive procedure. A TIPS shunt is a metal tube (also called a  stent) placed within the liver under x-ray guidance through an incision in the  jugular vein in the neck. A TIPS shunt works by decreasing the pressure against  which blood must flow within the liver (that is to reduce <em>portal hypertension</em>). TIPS shunts are used to treat patients with  severe difficulty with ascites or bleeding from varices that is not able to be  controlled with medication or endoscopy. Not all patients should receive a TIPS  shunt. TIPS shunt insertion has associated risks and the placement of TIPS  shunt can lead to new or <em>worsening  hepatic encephalopathy</em>.</p>
<p>For some patients with severe liver disease, <em>liver transplantation</em> may be considered  as a treatment option. During liver transplantation surgery the diseased liver  is removed and a new healthy liver from a deceased-donor or a part of a liver  from a living-donor is put in its place. Liver transplantation surgery is a  major undertaking and requires life-long anti-rejection medications afterwards.  Extensive testing is required before a liver transplant to ensure that a  candidate is in good enough health to proceed with a transplant operation. Additionally,  transplant centers typically require some period of abstinence from alcohol  (often at least 6 months) and/or formal alcohol and drug treatment for patients  with alcohol-related liver disease before transplantation. <em>Not all patients with cirrhosis need a liver transplant and  transplantation is not the best choice for all patients.</em> Although cirrhosis  due to chronic hepatitis C is the leading cause for liver transplantation in  the U.S., transplantation due to cirrhosis from fatty liver disease is  increasing across the country. Because liver transplantation is so complex it  is only performed at large specialty centers and your doctor may need to refer  you elsewhere in order to be evaluated for a liver transplant. </p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Liver transplantation involves replacing a patient&rsquo;s own (&ldquo;native&rdquo;)  diseased liver with a new liver obtained (&ldquo;harvested&rdquo;) from an organ donor. The  success of liver transplants over the last 30 years has dramatically changed  the care of patients with severe and irreversible liver disease, as this  lifesaving procedure can offer a return to good health and normal activities. Most  adult patients (&ldquo;recipients&rdquo;) who undergo a liver transplant have cirrhosis (extensive  scarring of the liver) or a primary liver cancer, whereas most pediatric  recipients require liver transplantation due to an inherited liver disease or hereditary  abnormality of the bile ducts. A liver transplant is a major surgery and  waiting times are long, but most recipients will regain their health and can  look forward to returning to their normal activities, although they will need  to continue long-term medications to prevent rejection of the new liver. The major limitation to the number of  patients that can be helped with liver transplant is the shortage of organ donors  resulting in many more potential recipients than available organs. It is of  note that the donated liver may be obtained from a deceased person or a living  person (the second referred to as living or live donor liver transplantation).  This can be particularly important in a potential liver transplant recipient  who otherwise might have a long wait for liver transplantation due to  relatively low MELD score (see below). For adult recipients a large portion of  the live donor&rsquo;s liver, typically the right lobe, is required whereas for  pediatric recipients the smaller left lobe from a live donor is usually  adequate.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Patients who require a liver transplant can have a variety of  symptoms including jaundice (yellowing of the eyes), ascites (fluid in the abdomen),  hepatic encephalopathy (confusion or even coma), and bleeding in the upper and  lower gastrointestinal tract from varices (large veins that form in the  esophagus or food pipe in patients with cirrhosis). Some cirrhotic patients may  have years of ill health whereas in other patients symptoms may develop  abruptly and suddenly as for instance with bleeding varices. In some types of  cirrhosis, for instance Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (&ldquo;PSC&rdquo;), other symptoms  may be prominent such as itching. Additional symptoms experienced by patients  who require a liver transplant may include severe fatigue, frequent bruising or  loss of muscle mass. Patients, or their partners, may also notice diminished  sexual drive. In patients with cirrhosis, primary liver cancer (hepatoma or  hepatocellular carcinoma) is an important complication, which fortunately can  often be detected by ultrasound, CT or MRI scan at an early stage, when it can  still be cured by transplant. A patient who requires liver transplant for this  reason may have surprisingly few symptoms as they may not have failure of the  non-cancerous liver. In children a frequent reason for liver transplant is  biliary atresia, which is failure of the bile ducts, the plumbing system in the  liver, to develop in the womb. Babies with this condition develop deep jaundice  shortly after birth. Although a surgical repair may be successful in some  infants ultimately many children with this condition may again become jaundiced  and develop other symptoms of liver failure such as ascites. An uncommon but  important indication for liver transplant in both children and adults is acute  (&ldquo;fulminant&rdquo;) liver failure in which a person with a previously normal liver  experiences severe damage to their liver and rapidly lapses into coma.  Deterioration in renal function is quite common in patients with liver failure.  This may occasionally lead to kidney failure requiring dialysis prior to  transplant.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The causes of liver disease requiring liver transplant are  by and large the major types of cirrhosis such as chronic hepatitis C  infection, long-term alcohol abuse, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and other  less common forms of cirrhosis such as Primary Biliary Cirrhosis. Nonalcoholic  fatty liver disease is an increasingly common cause of liver disease and  cirrhosis. This is due to abnormal deposition of fat in the liver and is more  commonly seen in patients with obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and/or  high cholesterol. A cause of cirrhosis, which has become less common due to  vaccination and the availability of effective antiviral drugs, is infection  with the hepatitis B virus. In contrast to most other causes of primary liver  cancer, chronic infection with hepatitis B can lead to primary hepatocellular  carcinoma even if cirrhosis has not yet developed. Another important type of  primary liver cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, develops in the bile ducts and can be  a complication of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis, which is a disease with  widespread scarring of the bile ducts. It can be very difficult to diagnose  cholangiocarcinoma at an early stage in these scarred ducts and may require  several different techniques. Although results for liver transplant have not  been as good for patients with cholangiocarcinoma as for primary hepatocellular  carcinoma at least some patients with cholangiocarcinoma may do well with  transplant if given addition treatments with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In  addition to cirrhosis and/or primary liver tumors, acute or fulminant liver  failure is a rare but important indication for liver transplant. This type of  liver disease occurs in a previously healthy person who suffers major injury to  their liver. Causes include an overdose of acetaminophen, acute infection with  one of the major hepatitis viruses such as A or B, and a variety of other  causes including injury from other drugs, viruses or unknown. </p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The major risk factors that lead to needing a liver  transplant are by and large the same risk factors for cirrhosis. These include  alcohol abuse, infection with hepatitis C and B, poorly controlled diabetes and  obesity leading to fatty liver, in addition to a number of other liver diseases  whose causes are poorly understood including PSC, Primary Biliary Cirrhosis,  Autoimmune Hepatitis and some hereditary diseases such as hemochromatosis (too  much iron in the body) and Wilson Disease (too much copper in the body). In  many patients who suffer from cirrhosis there may be more than one cause, for  instance a combination of alcohol excess and chronic hepatitis C infection. Some  inherited diseases such as Wilson Disease are entirely reversed following liver  transplantation.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of cirrhosis does not usually mean that a  liver transplant needs to be considered. There are effective medical treatments  for many of the major causes of cirrhosis, so liver transplant is only required  when a patient develops serious complications of their liver disease that  cannot be managed by medical treatments alone. However, even if the cirrhotic  patient responds to medical treatment for a complication such as ascites using  diuretics (&ldquo;water pills&rdquo;) the onset of this major complication of cirrhosis is  a warning that the patient is likely to develop increasing problems due to  their liver disease. Any patient with cirrhosis even without complications of  liver disease needs a regular checkup with a gastroenterologist at least twice  a year to monitor for complications including primary liver cancer. </p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Once cirrhosis is suspected, the patient requires a number  of tests to determine its cause and severity. The cause of liver disease may be  obvious from the history. For instance a history of heavy drinking in a patient  suggests that liver disease is due to alcohol excess. In most patients, the  accurate diagnosis of the cause of liver disease requires additional workup  including blood tests, X-Rays and on occasion liver biopsy. Blood work that is  usually ordered includes tests for hepatitis B or C, antibody tests for  autoimmune hepatitis and Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, and other tests to exclude  excessive iron (hemochromatosis) or excessive copper (Wilson Disease). For some  common disorders, like Fatty Liver Disease, there is no single diagnostic test.  As a result, the diagnosis is made in patients whose blood tests are negative  for other causes of liver disease and whose medical history and physical  examination are consistent. Additional blood tests include bilirubin, albumin  and INR which indicate the liver&rsquo;s ability to produce proteins and remove toxic  substances from the blood. X-rays are another important part of the workup and  include ultrasound, CT Scan and MRI. Although they do not usually diagnose the  cause of liver disease they may help in assessing the severity of liver disease  in patients who possibly have cirrhosis. These X-rays may show that the liver  looks &ldquo;nodular&rdquo; or lumpy due to scarring. In addition, X-rays provide details  about the blood vessels that provide the blood supply to the liver and drain  it. A blood clot in one of these vessels can make the liver disease worse. It  is also important for the transplant surgeon to have this information to plan  the transplant operation. In addition, X-rays of the liver are useful to look  for primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) which is common in  cirrhosis and affects decisions about liver transplantation. A liver biopsy is not  always necessary to diagnose cirrhosis and generally, a combination of blood  tests and X-rays are sufficient. In some cases a biopsy may be required to  confirm that the patient has cirrhosis or to try to find the cause of the liver  disease.</p>
<p>In addition to X-rays and blood tests, other special tests  may be performed. These include endoscopy to examine the esophagus (the  swallowing tube) and stomach looking for varices, which are veins that form in  patients with cirrhosis and can cause major bleeding. Fortunately it may be  possible to prevent this by using a type of blood pressure pill  (&ldquo;beta-blocker&rdquo;) or placing rubber bands (&ldquo;banding&rdquo;) during endoscopy to reduce  the risk of bleeding.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Once a patient&rsquo;s specialist, typically a gastroenterologist,  decides that a patient may need a liver transplant, a referral is made to a transplant  center where a number of doctor visits and additional testing occurs. The  reason for these is to make sure that the patient does not have any treatment  options for their liver disease apart from a liver transplant and that he or  she doesn&rsquo;t have any conditions such as severe heart disease or ongoing drug or  alcohol use which would make a transplant less likely to be successful. The  patient is assigned a nurse coordinator to oversee their care. The patient  typically sees the transplant hepatologist and transplant surgeon in addition  to other specialists such as cardiologists if needed. An important part of the  workup is a meeting with the social worker to make sure the patient and family  have the resources, both emotional and financial, to support the patient before  and after the transplant. If the patient has a history of drug or alcohol use  they also may be seen by a psychiatrist to come up with a plan to make sure  they will not have a relapse after transplant.</p>
<p>Once the patient has completed the workup their case is  discussed by all the specialists and staff involved. If everybody agrees the  patient is placed on the liver transplant list (&ldquo;listed&rdquo;) to wait for new  liver. Patients are generally listed according to their Model for End Stage Liver  Disease &ldquo;MELD&rdquo; score which is a mathematical formula to measure the severity of  a patient&rsquo;s liver disease. MELD scores vary between 5 and 40, with a higher  score indicating a worse outcome and therefore a higher priority on the waiting  list for available donors. Donor livers are generally assigned based on how  high the MELD score is as well as by blood group. In most cases, the time on  the waiting list has little bearing on the priority for transplantation. In  general, patients are evaluated for placement on the liver transplantation list  when their MELD score exceeds 15. There are some exceptions to this, including  patients with liver cancer, who are given MELD exemptions to receive a  transplant before their cancer progresses especially as liver  cancer patients may not have liver failure to give them a MELD score high  enough to receive a transplant. Patients who have kidney failure associated  with liver failure are sometimes considered for combined liver and kidney  transplantation on a case by case basis. </a>While the patient is waiting they  are seen for regular checkups including blood tests and X-rays at the  transplant center. The patient needs to keep in close contact with their  transplant coordinator while waiting for liver transplant.</p>
<p>Once a potential donor organ is identified the patient is notified  that there is an &ldquo;offer&rdquo;. If the offer looks like it may be suitable the  patient is advised to come to the hospital to be prepared for surgery. The  operation is generally at least several hours long and involves a team of  surgeons. After the surgery the patient is moved to the Intensive Care Unit for  the first few days post-transplant. After this, if the recovery is on schedule,  the patient will be moved to a regular hospital floor for several days before being  discharged from the hospital. The patient will receive medications to prevent  rejection. In addition, because these anti-rejection medications make a patient  more liable to various types of infection, antibiotics are prescribed. Following  transplant the patient is seen to monitor liver function and adjust the doses  of the major rejection medications based on blood levels. If the liver tests  become abnormal a liver biopsy may be performed to find out if there is  rejection present. If so the patient may require additional rejection  medications. </p>
<p>Other important issues in the patient who has undergone  liver transplant include side effects of the rejection medications such as high  blood pressure and diabetes. In addition any patient who has a liver transplant  is at increased risk of developing various types of tumors, most frequently  skin, so a regular checkup with a dermatologist is crucial. </p>
<p>Despite these concerns, a successful liver transplant allows  a patient to return to a nearly normal lifestyle with an increased sense of  wellbeing and much better prognosis. With time, the amount of rejection  medications can be reduced, further improving the patient&rsquo;s quality of life.</p>
<p>Liver transplant is truly a modern medical miracle.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>One of  the main functions of the liver is to break down substances that we take by  mouth, including medications, herbs and supplements. This process usually takes  place efficiently and without causing any harm. When new medications are  developed, they are extensively tested in many people prior to being approved  for general use. During this period careful tests are done to ensure that the  liver is not damaged. For this reason, the vast majority of the medications  currently available are safe even for people with known liver disease.</p>
<p>Despite  these safeguards sometimes medications can harm the liver. In some instances, a  person can have a rare tendency that makes their liver susceptible to injury  after taking a certain medication â we call this an idiosyncratic reaction. It  happens in very rare instances and often cannot be predicted. Occasionally,  medications that proved safe during testing are found to be potentially harmful  when they are released for general use and millions of people take it. In other  instances, people with liver disease may be at increased risk of developing  liver damage when certain medications are used. Medications that are known to  be toxic to people with liver disease usually carry a warning regarding its use  in people with liver problems.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>In most  cases substantial liver damage can occur before symptoms appear. Typical  symptoms of liver disease may include nausea, lack of appetite, discomfort on  the right upper corner of the abdomen, generalized itching, dark urine and  jaundice (yellow discoloration of the eyes and skin), but many people have no  symptoms at all. Blood tests can usually detect evidence of liver damage before  symptoms develop. When a medication known to possibly cause liver damage is  used, your physician may recommend that blood tests be checked periodically  after starting the medication so that any evidence of liver damage can be  detected before symptoms appear.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Liver  damage of any type is usually detected by doing blood tests. Usually there is  no need to monitor the liver tests when a medication is started. If your  physician is planning on using a medication that in the past has been shown to  rarely cause liver damage, the most common test used to monitor the liver is a  liver panel, which consists of several blood tests that detect liver damage. These  tests are: AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AP  (alkaline phosphatase) and bilirubin. There are many other causes for elevated  liver tests. For that reason your physician may obtain a baseline liver panel  prior to starting a medication to be sure that it is normal.</p>
<p>Minor  elevations of these tests may occur after starting a medication and do not  indicate significant liver damage. Generally speaking physicians are most  concerned about serious medication-induced liver damage when the levels of AST  and ALT rise 3 to 5 times or more over baseline or if there is an increase in  bilirubin. If the elevations are minor, the medication is continued and the  liver tests monitored. In most cases, the liver tests will return to normal  despite continuing the medication.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The best  known medication that can damage the liver is acetaminophen, also known as  TylenolÂ®. This medication is widely available without prescription  and is present in many of the cold and flu remedies sold in drugstores as well  as in prescription pain medications. Â Most pain medications that are labeled as  ânon-aspirinâ have acetaminophen as its main ingredient.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen,  when used as directed, is extremely safe even for people with liver disease. However,  taking too much acetaminophen at once, or taking a high dose of acetaminophen  continuously over several days can cause damage to the liver. Healthy  individuals should not take more than 1,000 mg of acetaminophen per dose, and  should not take more than 3,000mg in one day (i.e. maximum of 1,000 mg every 8  hours). In addition, even healthy persons should avoid taking 3,000mg of  acetaminophen daily for more than 3 to 5 days. Patients with liver disease  should restrict the daily amount of acetaminophen to 2,000mg per day, or even  less if severe liver disease is present. Even if you have no liver disease,  always use the smallest amount of acetaminophen needed to obtain relief. It is  important that you read the labels of all prescription and non-prescription  medications that you take. Often acetaminophen may be present in several  medications which could cause you to take a dose of acetaminophen that exceeds  the safe limits.</p>
<p>People  who drink alcoholic beverages regularly are at higher risk of developing severe  liver damage from acetaminophen. Drinking alcohol regularly changes the way the  liver breaks down certain medications. In the case of acetaminophen, alcohol  use leads to accumulation in the liver of a toxic byproduct of acetaminophen  that can kill the liver cells. People who drink alcohol regularly should not  take acetaminophen or take it is small doses if at all.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Another  common group of medications that can affect the liver tests are the cholesterol  lowering medications commonly known as âstatinsâ; a group that includes many of  the currently prescribed medications to lower cholesterol. These medications  have been used in millions of people with an excellent safety record and very  little evidence of liver damage, even when used in people with mild liver  disease. It is not rare, however, for people to develop minor elevations of the  liver tests soon after they start taking these medications. In the vast  majority of cases, these elevations are less than 3 times the baseline level  and the levels return to normal despite continued use of the medication;  recently the FDA discontinued the recommendation for routine monitoring of  liver tests when starting a patient on statins. If the liver tests are  monitored, the medication should not be stopped if only minor elevations of  liver tests are noted.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Supplements  and herbs, despite being ânaturalâ can be toxic to the liver. The production  and distribution of these supplements is not regulated as carefully as the  production of prescription medications. âNaturalâ products can be sold with  little testing and with no proof of efficacy. Sometimes the herb or supplement  itself can cause liver damage. In other cases, impurities or toxins introduced  during the preparation of the product may be toxic to the liver. Some of the  natural products known to be toxic to the liver include chaparral, comfrey tea,  kava, skullcap, and yohimbe, but there are many others. Even vitamin supplements  and dietary supplements, such as weight losing products, can be harmful. Too  much iron or vitamin A can result in significant liver damage. Generally  speaking, you do not need to take iron supplements unless you have been  diagnosed with iron deficiency. Vitamin A dose should never exceed 5,000 units  a day, unless provided as beta-carotene.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>With  very rare exceptions, people that have mild liver disease can safely take most  common prescription and non-prescription medications at the recommended dose. Having  mild liver disease such as hepatitis C or fatty liver does not increase the  risk that a given medication will be toxic to the liver, however, if a person  with pre-existing liver disease happens to develop liver injury from a  medication, the resulting liver damage may be more severe than would occur in  an otherwise healthy person with the same reaction. For that reason, whenever  possible, physicians prefer to use âliver-safeâ medications when we know a  person has liver disease.</p>
<p>Often  physicians may be reluctant to start patients on a cholesterol lowering  medication if the liver tests are already mildly elevated; usually due to fatty  liver disease. Research has shown that cholesterol lowering medications are  safe in people with fatty liver disease or mild hepatitis C infection, and in  fact, may be beneficial to the liver by decreasing inflammation.</p>
<p>People  with more severe types of liver disease such as cirrhosis have to be more  careful regarding the types and dose of medications they take. While the  ability of the liver to properly break down and utilize medications is  preserved even when severe liver disease is present, there are some medications  that should not be used or should be used at reduced dose when given to  patients with advanced cirrhosis.</p>
<p> <strong>Recommendations to Minimize the  Risk of Liver Injury from Medications</strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Always keep a list of all       the prescription and non-prescription medications that you take, including       herbs, vitamins and supplements. Bring this list with you to every       physicianâs appointment.</li>
  <li>The fewer medications you       take the better. This includes herbs, supplements, prescription and       non-prescription medications. If you have several physicians prescribing       medications for you, be sure all of them are updated on your current list       of medications.</li>
  <li>When using non-prescription       medications, be sure to read the label carefully and never exceed the       recommended amount. Avoid taking the maximum recommended dose for a       prolonged period without consulting a physician. </li>
  <li>If you are taking several       medications, be sure the ingredients are not the same; otherwise you may       risk taking an accidental overdose.</li>
  <li>If you drink a significant       amount of alcohol daily, avoid or restrict the use of acetaminophen; never       take the maximum recommended dose.</li>
  <li>If you have liver disease,       make sure that your physician is aware of your diagnosis and the severity       of your liver disease.</li>
  <li>If you have advanced liver       disease such as severe cirrhosis, it is a good idea to consult with the       liver specialist before starting new medications.</li>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an uncommon, chronic Progressive disorder that leads to scarring and inflammation of the medium and large bile ducts of the liver. The disease leads to progressive destruction and blockage of the bile ducts and inability of the liver to secrete bile into the intestines. Bile is a substance that is produced by the liver and helps with digestion of dietary fat. Bile ducts function as the liverâs plumbing system and allow bile to flow out of the liver. When bile backs up in the liver, progressive scarring of the liver occurs which leads to cirrhosis.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-psc/" class="faqquestion">What causes PSC?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The cause of PSC is unknown. Studies suggest impairment of the immune system or chronic infections as likely causes. Although it appears possible, it is not known if heredity plays a role, that is, if a person can inherit PSC if other members in the family are affected.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-psc/" class="faqquestion">How common is PSC?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>PSC is rare. Seventy percent of patients with PSC are men. The average age at diagnosis is forty years. Up to ninety percent of patients with PSC have some form of inflammatory bowel disease. Ulcerative colitis is the more common of the two forms of inflammatory bowel disease and occurs in approximately eighty-seven percent of PSC patients. Crohn's disease is seen in the remaining thirteen percent. Alternatively, only four percent of all patients with inflammatory bowel disease have PSC.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-psc/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of PSC?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The majority of patients with PSC have no symptoms at all. However, some patients complain of tiredness, itching or diarrhea. Fevers, chills, jaundice (yellow discoloration of the eyes and skin) and abdominal pain may occur in some patients. Some patients have a slow progressive course where the disease does not cause symptoms or complications for many years. Other patients may have a rapidly progressive course with the early development of bile duct obstruction, cirrhosis and liver failure.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-psc/" class="faqquestion">What tests are needed to evaluate PSC?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<ul><li>Blood tests</li>

<p>The first step to screen patients for PSC is to do blood tests. In PSC, liver test should be evaluated. Specifically, the liver blood test called alkaline phosphatase (AP) is often abnormal, though a small percent of patients with PSC may have normal levels. Other liver enzymes including the aminotransferases (ALT and AST) may also be abnormal. Bilirubin levels are normal early in the disease, then begin to increase in a fluctuating manner depending on the degree of blockage or stricturing of the bile ducts. A significant rise in the alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin can indicate a stricture in the main bile duct. The albumin and prothrombin time are proteins made only in the liver and are secreted into blood. When these blood tests are abnormal, they signify worsening liver function.</p>

  <li>Cholangiogram</li>

<p>A cholangiogram may be a useful test for diagnosing PSC. Cholangiography can be performed several ways. Cholangiography is an X-ray test that involves injection of contrast into the bile ducts. A cholangiogram is usually performed using an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic (ERCP) scope, which is a special upper endoscopy instrument useful for examining the bile, liver and pancreatic ducts. ERCP is a test that involves the insertion of a small flexible tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach then into the first part of the small intestine called the duodenum. In the duodenum there is a tiny opening called the ampulla, which is connected to the main bile duct. Bile flows from the liver through this opening into the small intestine. A small plastic catheter can be passed through the scope, into the ampulla and advanced into the bile duct where dye can be injected and any strictures viewed using X-ray pictures. If a patient cannot undergo an ERCP, a transhepatic cholangiogram may be performed instead. The transhepatic cholangiogram involves taking x-ray pictures of the bile ducts following insertion of a needle through the skin directly into the liver and the dye being injected into the bile ducts. In PSC, the bile ducts both within and outside of the liver may have areas of narrowing (strictures) and dilatations producing a beaded appearance that is characteristic of this disease. Both tests are done using sedation (medication to improve patient comfort during the procedure).</p>

  <li>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</li>

<p>Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an alternative diagnostic test to ERCP and transhepatic cholangiogram for making the diagnosis of PSC. MRCP is a safe and non-invasive test that takes images of the bile pancreatic ductsand has replaced ERCP as the first imaging test in patients suspected of having PSC. Published data has demonstrated that the predictive positive and predictive negative values for MRI in diagnosis of PSC are both 80%.</p>

  <li>Liver Biopsy</li>

<p>A liver biopsy is a test used to obtain liver tissue that is examined under a microscope. It involves the insertion of a needle, typically between the ribs on the right side of the abdomen, into the liver for the purpose of obtaining a tiny sample. Local anesthesia is used before inserting the needle. The tissue specimen is then examined under a microscope. A liver biopsy can be helpful in making the diagnosis of PSC and in assessing the severity of scarring and extent of liver damage. Hence, a biopsy may be helpful in determining prognosis.</p></ul>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-psc/" class="faqquestion">What are the complicatons of PSC?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Patients with PSC are at risk for developing other associated problems.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dominant Stricture</li>
</ul>
<p>A dominant stricture is a blockage in one of the large bile ducts that serve to drain bile from the smaller bile ducts within the liver and deliver it into the small intestine. A dominant stricture occurs in seven to twenty percent of patients with PSC. When a dominant stricture is present, bile is blocked from flowing through the bile duct and, therefore, may back up in the liver. Substances that are normally excreted into bile accumulate in the bloodstream and body tissues. This can lead to jaundice (yellowish discoloration of the eyes and skin), stone formation in the bile ducts and infection in the bile ducts known as cholangitis. At ERCP a piece of plastic tubing called a âstentâcan be placed across a dominant stricture in an effort to relieve the blockage.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fat Soluble Vitamin Deficiencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Vitamins A, D, E and K, are known as fat-soluble vitamins because they dissolve in oils rather than water. One function of bile is that it improves the intestineâs ability to dissolve and absorb these vitamins. If bile from the liver does not get into the intestines in adequate amounts, fat-soluble vitamins may not get absorbed and deficiencies can occur. Blockage of bile ducts may also cause diarrhea because fat in the diet will be poorly absorbed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Osteoporosis</li>
</ul>
<p>Osteoporosis or bone thinning is another complication of PSC. The cause of osteoporosis in PSC is unclear. As a result, a bone density scan (also called a dual-energy x-ray absortiometry, or DEXA scan) should be obtained at regular intervals.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cholangiocarcinoma</li>
</ul>
<p>The risk of developing cancer involving the bile ducts (known as cholangiocarcinoma) is higher in patients with PSC than in a healthy population. Cholangiocarcinoma may occur in 7 to 15% of patients with PSC. Patients with a long history of inflammatory bowel disease and smokers are at the highest risk. As there are no early symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma that make it easy to distinguish from symptoms of PSC, it is difficult to diagnose early. Researchers and physicians continue to work on ways of making early diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cirrhosis</li>
</ul>
<p>Cirrhosis is a process of advanced scarring of the liver. Fibrosis or scarring of the liver seen in cirrhosis leads to a decrease of blood flow through the liver. This prevents the liver from performing its critical functions of purifying the blood and nutrients absorbed from the intestines. The end result is liver failure.</p>
<p>Cirrhosis is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States and can be caused by many other processes such as a genetic disorder called hemochromatosis, viral infections, such as hepatitis or by alcoholism. To learn more about cirrhosis and its potential complications, please click here to access a patient brochure published by the ACG on cirrhosis.</p>
<p>Patients with PSC may develop secondary problems that may ultimately result in irreversible liver failure. These problems include bleeding from swollen veins (varices) most commonly in the esophagus, collection of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) and legs, and episodes of confusion (hepatic encephalopathy) due to the inability of the scarred liver to remove toxins from the blood stream.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Colon Cancer</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an increased risk of colon cancer in patients with PSC that also have inflammatory bowel disease. Colonoscopy with biopsies throughout the colon once a year is recommended.</p>
<h3>What are the treatments for PSC?</h3>
<p>Many medications have been studied but none have proven to alter the course of PSC. This is primarily due to uncertainty regarding its cause. Medications such as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), colchicine, steroids and methotrexate have been used to treat PSC. Studies evaluating higher doses of UDCA than had been used previously are ongoing.</p>
<p>Therapy is directed towards treating symptoms, preventing and managing complications of PSC. Patients with PSC should avoid anything that may cause or worsen liver damage such as alcohol. Vaccinations for hepatitis A and B should be administered. Vitamin supplements should be prescribed for patients with advanced disease at risk for deficiencies. Medications such as diphenhydramine, cholestyramine, rifampin and phenobarbital have been helpful in relieving itching. Osteoporosis is managed with supplemental calcium and vitamin D. Treatment of itching and osteoporosis in PSC is similar to that used for treating Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (see below). Alendronate is a medication often used to decrease further bone loss that may help in PSC.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-psc/" class="faqquestion">When should liver transplantation be considered?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Patients who develop complications of cirrhosis and those with recurrent cholangitis are candidates for liver transplantation. Liver transplantation is the only effective treatment for patients who have developed late stage PSC (cirrhosis). Studies have shown that approximately eighty to ninety percent of patients who undergo liver transplantation for late stage PSC are alive one to three years later. After transplantation, many patients report having a good quality of life.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/primary-biliary-cirrhosis-pbc/" class="faqquestion">
What is PBC?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic liver disease that is characterized by inflammation and progressive destruction of the bile ducts. PBC is usually diagnosed in patients between the ages of 35 to 60 years. About 90 to 95 percent of patients are women. Liver inflammation over a long period of time may cause scarring which leads to cirrhosis. The cause of PBC is unknown, but it is most likely an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease is a process where the immune system attacks a specific tissue in the body. In PBC, it is thought that the immune system attacks and destroys small bile duct cells in the liver. It is not uncommon for patients with PBC to have other associated autoimmune diseases including pernicious anemia, scleroderma, or thyroid disorders. In addition, there are environmental factors such as infections, which may trigger the disease. Due to widespread laboratory screening, the number of patients being diagnosed early in the asymptomatic stage has risen dramatically over the past decade. More than 60 percent of newly diagnosed PBC patients now are asymptomatic.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/primary-biliary-cirrhosis-pbc/" class="faqquestion">What are the signs and symptoms of PBC?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Many patients may not have symptoms for years, and some may never have complaints relating to their disease. Because of the varying and sometimes subtle symptoms, doctors may have difficulty initially making the diagnosis. Signs and symptoms may include the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Hypercholesterolemia (elevated cholesterol levels)</li>
  <li>Intense itching of the skin (pruritus)</li>
  <li>Dry eyes and mouth (sicca syndrome)</li>
</ul>
Most patients however are asympomatic, and the diagnosis is made on the basis of an elevated alkaline phosphatase level in the blood.

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/primary-biliary-cirrhosis-pbc/" class="faqquestion">What type of tests are needed to evaluate PBC?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Many patients are now diagnosed before symptoms are present. Typically, screening level blood tests show a higher than normal alkaline phosphatase (AP) level with a normal bilirubin. Usually, the bilirubin does not increase until a late stage of the disease. Your doctor may decide to conduct one or more of the following tests.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><em>Anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA) blood test</em>Â - Up to 95% of patients with PBC will have a positive AMA test. This test is used to help confirm a diagnosis of PBC. However the AMA tends to remain stable, and has no value in following disease progression, or in monitoring the response to treatment.</li>
  <li><em>Liver function tests</em>Â - Blood tests that are specific for liver disease are total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aminotransferase levels (ALT, AST), albumin and prothrombin time.</li>
  <li><em>Cholesterol and triglyceride levels</em>Â - These blood tests are often increased.</li>
  <li><em>Ultrasound exam of the liver</em>Â - Images of the liver and bile ducts are taken to assess for liver abnormalities. These imaging studies are usually normal in PBC.</li>
</ul>
<em>Liver biopsy</em>Â - A small sample of liver tissue helps to confirm the diagnosis and determines the severity of the liver damage. A liver biopsy is not always necessary, especially if the AMA is positive, the alkalkine phosphatase is 3-4 times normal, and the imaging studies are normal.

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/primary-biliary-cirrhosis-pbc/" class="faqquestion">Treatment of complications of PBC</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Some patients have complications of PBC that require therapy. In many cases, doctors find that symptoms can be controlled by lifestyle modifications and medications.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Itching</li>

<p>Itching can be a very troublesome symptom of PBC. Itching may range from mild to severe, where a patientâs lifestyle may be impaired. Itching may be worse with fatty meals or at night, interfering with sleep. The initial medications typically used by doctors include diphenhydramine, cholestyramine and colestipol. Rifampin is used in patients who fail or are intolerant to cholestyramine and colestipol. In resistant cases, opioid antagonists such as nalmefene, naloxone and naltrexone are used. Plasmapheresis and ultraviolet light have been utilized in extreme cases. Liver transplantation is indicated for patients with uncontrolled itching.</p>

  <li>Osteoporosis</li>

When the diagnosis of PBC is made, a bone mineral density scan (DEXA scan) should be performed to determine if a patient has osteoporosis or bone thinning. In many cases, doctors may suggest that their patients start exercising if possible, stop smoking and take calcium 1500 mg/day with vitamin D 1,000 IU/day. Hormone replacement therapy (estrogen) is safe in PBC and is recommended where appropriate. When osteoporosis is evident, therapy with medications such as FosamaxÂ® (alendronate) and ActonelÂ® may be helpful in PBC.

  <li>Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies</li>

<p>As PBC progresses, some patients lose the ability to absorb fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. Measurement and replacement of these vitamins is recommended.</p>

  <li>Esophageal varices</li>

<p>Varices are swollen veins which form in the esophagus and stomach. When blood is returning to the heart, it must pass through the liver. In PBC, the pressures encountered in the liver may be so high that the blood flow will shunt through the esophagus or stomach. The dilated veins that form as a result are called varices, and can potentially result in serious bleeding. Patients with PBC should undergo regular endoscopies for variceal surveillance and treatment if necessary.</p>
</ul>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/primary-biliary-cirrhosis-pbc/" class="faqquestion">Treatment of underlying disease</a>
<div class="faqanswer"><ul>
  <li>Ursodiol</li>

<p>Ursodiol is currently the only drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of PBC and it is often the initial therapy for patients. The drug is a âgentlerâ bile acid than those normally made by the body and is well tolerated. Studies have shown that ursodiol, given in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg daily up to four years, delays the time to liver transplantation. In addition to improving blood tests, there are some patients with PBC whose disease appears to become inactive (remission) on ursodiol. Repeat or even serial liver biopsies may be required in order to document remission.</p>

  <li>Colchicine</li>

<p>Colchicine is associated with improvement of liver tests in some patients with PBC and improved itching in two recent studies. However, there was no improvement in liver biopsy findings and therefore this medication is not commonly used to treat PBC.</p>

  <li>Methotrexate</li>

<p>In early studies, methotrexate had appeared to be associated with improvement in symptoms, liver function tests and liver biopsies. However, an 8-year multicenter NIH trial has clearly documented that the use of Methotrexate is not associated with improvements in liver disease and the development of complications of cirrhosis.</p>
</ul>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/primary-biliary-cirrhosis-pbc/" class="faqquestion">Liver Transplantation</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Many people with PBC may never develop cirrhosis or liver failure. However, as can be seen in PSC, a late stage of PBC can be liver failure. For those people who reach the late stages of PBC, liver transplantation may be considered. The signs and symptoms of liver failure, which may or (depending on the specific aspects of the symptoms / disease) may not prompt consideration of any potential role for liver transplant, are the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Persistent jaundice</li>
  <li>Fluid retention with swelling of hands, feet and abdomen</li>
  <li>Variceal bleeding (internal bleeding from swollen intestinal blood vessels, commonly in upper stomach and esophagus)</li>
  <li>Bone thinning and/or fractures</li>
  <li>Hepatic coma or encephalopathy</li>
</ul>
<p>The survival for PBC patients after liver transplantation is excellent although some patients may develop recurrent PBC over time. With better understanding of the nature of PBC and its complications, many patients will have improved outcomes.</p>

What is Hepatitis?</a>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. This inflammation may be due to viruses, medicines, alcohol, problems with the immune system, or not enough blood supply to the liver.</p>
<p>The liver is an essential organ in the body and carries out a wide range of functions, including removing poisons from the body, storing energy, and regulating blood clotting.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/viral-hepatitis/" class="faqquestion">What is Viral Hepatitis?</a>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Although other viruses can involve the liver, viral hepatitis refers to inflammation of the liver due to one of several viruses that specifically attack the liver. These viruses are labeled with the letters A, B, C, D and E. The most important viruses in the United States are viral hepatitis A, B and C.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/viral-hepatitis/" class="faqquestion">How is Viral Hepatitis transmitted?</a>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Viral hepatitis A and E enter the body by way of the gastrointestinal tract. One gets these viruses by eating food or drinking fluids contaminated with the virus, usually from the stool of an infected person. Hepatitis A may also be transmitted in areas where there is overcrowding, such as day care centers and correctional facilities, from eating raw shell fish that came from water contaminated with sewage, or by sexual (usually anal-oral) contact. Hepatitis E, although similar to hepatitis A, is not frequently seen in the United States. This virus is seen primarily in the Indian subcontinent and in certain areas of Africa. It is transmitted primarily by fecal-oral contamination (as mentioned above).</p>
<p>The hepatitis B and C viruses are generally transmitted by contact with infected blood or blood products, or by sexual contact. In the United States, intravenous drug use is the most frequent mode of transmission of hepatitis C. Heterosexual transmission is uncommon for hepatitis C though men having sex with men is being recognized increasingly as a risk factor for hepatitis C transmission. Hepatitis B is commonly transmitted sexually as well as through intravenous drug use, and can also be passed from a mother to her fetus, usually at the time of delivery.</p>
<p>Hepatitis D (sometimes referred to as Delta hepatitis) only afflicts individuals who have the hepatitis B infection. The mode of transmission of hepatitis D is similar to that of hepatitis B. </p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/viral-hepatitis/" class="faqquestion">What is Acute Viral Hepatitis and what are its symptoms and consequences?</a>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Acute viral hepatitis refers to inflammation of the liver associated with symptoms and abnormalities of liver enzymes, which last for a period less than six months.  All of the viruses mentioned above can cause acute hepatitis.  The symptoms of acute viral hepatitis can include low-grade fever, headaches, muscle ache, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dark-colored urine or light-colored stools.  The most notable symptom of acute viral hepatitis is jaundice, which is a yellow discoloration of the skin and the whites of the eyes.  Patients also usually complain of vague upper abdominal pain.  Very few patients with acute viral hepatitis go on to develop liver failure that would require liver transplantation or lead to death.  However, hepatitis E may have serious consequences if a person is infected during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Except for patients infected with hepatitis C, most cases of acute viral hepatitis will disappear on their own.  With hepatitis C, more than 80% of patients will develop a persistent infection called chronic hepatitis.  Although most of those with acute hepatitis B will resolve their infection, a significant number of infants and young children with hepatitis B will develop chronic hepatitis B.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/viral-hepatitis/" class="faqquestion">What is Chronic Hepatitis? What are its consequences?</a>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Chronic viral hepatitis refers to ongoing inflammation and/or abnormalities of liver enzymes which last more than six months.  Most patients who develop chronic hepatitis will have life-long disease unless they are treated.  Chronic viral hepatitis in the United States is limited primarily to hepatitis B and C.  Consequences of chronic viral hepatitis may include progressive liver disease, including cirrhosis and its complications, liver failure, liver cancer, and bleeding disorders, although many patients will never develop any of these complications.  Furthermore, chronic hepatitis may be accelerated in people who use drugs that are toxic to the liver (including alcohol).  Most of these complications can be prevented by early diagnosis and early treatment, and in the case of hepatitis B, vaccination will prevent acute infection in case of exposure to hepatitis B.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/viral-hepatitis/" class="faqquestion">How is Viral Hepatitis diagnosed?</a>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Viral hepatitis (both acute and chronic) can be easily diagnosed using simple blood tests.  While a liver sample (called a biopsy) is not required in the vast majority of cases, it may sometimes be helpful, especially in difficult to diagnose cases or when deciding on treatment based on the severity of the liver scarring.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/viral-hepatitis/" class="faqquestion">How is Viral Hepatitis treated?</a>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Acute viral hepatitis generally does not require treatment, as most patients will get better on their own.  Acute hepatitis C is a notable exception, because only 15% of patients will clear the virus on their own and most people, if not treated, will develop chronic hepatitis C.  In addition, there is a very high cure rate when patients are treated during the acute hepatitis infection stage.</p>

<p>Chronic hepatitis treatments are available for hepatitis B and C, the most predominant causes of chronic hepatitis.  Chronic hepatitis B is usually treated by medications that interfere with the virusâ ability to multiply and replicate.  These medications include oral medications as well as injectable medications.  Approved medications for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B include the injectable pegylated interferons, as well as medications taken by mouth called directly acting antivirals (DAAâs).  These DAAâs are virtually free of any side effects and are the mainstay of therapy.  No medication is currently available which will rid the body completely free of the hepatitis B virus (cure).  These medications keep the virus under excellent control, but will not completely eliminate the virus.  The duration of treatment may vary from one year for the pegylated interferon to possibly indefinite for the oral DAAs.  Research is ongoing on the medications that will completely eliminate the virus and achieve what scientists refer to as a functional cure. </p>
<p>Major advances have been made in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection.  Currently, medications taken by mouth (called directly acting antivirals, or DAAs) have completely replaced the injectable medications (called pegylated interferons).  These medications, which are taken by mouth, are specific for the type of virus the patient has, called genotype, of which there are six, (1-6).  The oral medication ribavirin is still used in some patients with chronic hepatitis C.  In the very near future, single tablet medications will be used to treat all of the six genotypes for hepatitis C!  That cure rate with the currently available medications for hepatitis C is almost 100%.  Although the cost of treatment for both viruses, especially hepatitis C have increased significantly, it is highly recommended that patients are treated as early as possible before they develop chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.  The duration of treatment may be from eight weeks to 24 weeks.</p>
<p>Chronic viral hepatitis B and C should be treated by individuals who are knowledgeable of these conditions, the medications utilized to treat these conditions, and the side effects of these medications.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/viral-hepatitis/" class="faqquestion">Why is it important to treat Chronic Hepatitis? Are there side effects associated with the medications used to treat Chronic Hepatitis B and C?</a>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The main reason to treat chronic viral hepatitis is to prevent cirrhosis of the liver, during which the liver becomes scarred and gradually loses its ability to function.  This can ultimately lead to liver failure or liver cancer.  Another reason for treatment is to prevent the spread of infection.  The longer a patient has chronic hepatitis, the more likely it is that cirrhosis will develop.  Therefore, early diagnosis is crucial for initiating treatment as soon as possible.  Unfortunately, since chronic viral hepatitis is usually not associated with symptoms, most patients remain undiagnosed.  </p>
<p>As I have said previously, the injectable medications (interferon) are no longer recommended for patients with hepatitis C.  The DAAs mentioned above may be used alone or in combination with ribavirin, both taken by mouth.  The side effects are minimal for the DAAâs, and include a headache or difficulty with sleeping.  Some of the medications may have interactions with other medications taken by the patient.  Your doctor will advise you of these possible interactions.  Ribavirin side effects may be more prominent, and include anemia, skin problems, or breathing problems.  Difficulties with sleeping may also be seen with ribavirin.  All of the side effects are minimal and are quite manageable.</p>
<p>Hepatitis B may be treated with injectable medications (as mentioned above), or oral medications (DAAs).  The interferons have side effects, which include anemia, depression, and other problems and while they are a recommended therapy, are much less commonly used in the United States than the oral medications.  The oral medications have virtually no side effects and are quite safe.  It may be necessary to give them indefinitely.  All of these medications, however, may require adjustments of doses and frequency in patients who have kidney disease.  As mentioned previously, patients with chronic viral hepatitis should be treated in a center with a great deal of expertise in the management of these side effects.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/viral-hepatitis/" class="faqquestion">Can Viral Hepatitis be prevented?</a>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Most cases of viral hepatitis can be prevented by using common sense precautions.  Since hepatitis A and E viruses are transmitted through contaminated foods and liquids, patients should not eat or drink in areas with unsanitary conditions.  Hence, international travelers should only consume bottled water, not use ice in beverages, and avoid food sold from street vendors.  Also, individuals traveling to areas with high rates of hepatitis A should receive the hepatitis A vaccine in two (2) doses, six to 18 months apart.  </p>
<p>Other people who should receive the hepatitis A vaccine include men who have sex with men, intravenous and other drug users, people with clotting factor disorders like hemophilia, people with chronic liver disease, and children who live in areas that have historically high rates of hepatitis A.  For short term protection (for example, short term travel to endemic areas), immune globulin (IG) shots may be given.  This is generally needed for people who are going to remain in those areas for a period of less than one month.  This IG shot can temporarily prevent you from contracting the virus.  An IG shot may also be given for protection within 2 weeks following exposure to a known hepatitis A carrier.</p>
<p>Most patients with acute hepatitis B will get better on their own, but this is a preventable disease.  The best method of prevention is vaccination.  The hepatitis B vaccine is highly effective in preventing the infection.  Individuals who should receive this vaccine include those who use intravenous and other drugs, men who have sex with men, individuals with high-risk sexual behavior, and individuals with multiple sexual partners.  As pregnant women who carry the virus are very likely to transmit it to their baby, newborns of hepatitis B infected mothers should receive the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth.  It is also recommended that an IG (immune globulin) shot be given at the same time.  This method is highly effective in preventing infection of the newborn.  If the mother also has high amounts of the virus in her blood stream, it is recommended that she receive an oral antiviral agent after the second trimester of pregnancy to further reduce the risk of transmission to her baby.  </p>
<p>Most states currently require hepatitis B vaccination of all newborns, as well as âcatch-upâ vaccination for children and adolescents.  A combined hepatitis A and B vaccine (TwinrixÂ®) is also available for people who need both vaccines.  These vaccines offer lifelong immunity (as does recovery from infection) unless the patient has underlying immune disease or kidney failure. </p>
</div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/viral-hepatitis/" class="faqquestion">I heard that some medications such as herbal medications can cure Hepatitis. Is this true?</a>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Although some herbal medicines may briefly improve liver enzymes, there is currently no evidence that any medicines (other than those previously mentioned) can cure viral hepatitis.  The most common herbal medicine, milk thistle showed no benefit in hepatitis C.  One should never use any prescription or over-the-counter medications without consulting a physician first.  Additionally, some herbal medications may seriously damage the liver.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis/" class="faqquestion">
What is Ulcerative Colitis?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disease marked by inflammation of the lining of the colon and rectum, together known as the large intestine.  This inflammation causes irritation in the lining of the large intestine, which leads to the symptoms of UC.  Though UC always affects the lowest part of the large intestine (the rectum), in some patients it can be present throughout the entire colon.  UC belongs to a group of diseases called inflammatory bowel diseases, which also includes Crohnâs disease (CD).  Though it was once thought that UC and CD were two different diseases, as many as 10% of patients may have features of both diseases, and this is called indeterminate colitis.  It is important to note that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is different from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of UC?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The symptoms of ulcerative colitis depend on the severity of inflammation and the amount of the colon that is affected by the disease.  In patients with mild to moderate inflammation, symptoms can include rectal bleeding, diarrhea, mild abdominal cramping, stool urgency, and tenesmus (discomfort and the feeling that you have not completely emptied your rectum after a bowel movement).  When more severe inflammation is present, patients often develop fever, dehydration, severe abdominal pain, weight loss, loss of appetite or growth retardation (in children and adolescents with UC).  Individuals with moderate or severe inflammation may also have to wake up at night to have bowel movements and may lose control of bowel movements.  Some of the symptoms of UC may be non-specific and could be caused by other diseases such as Crohnâs disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or infection.  Your doctor can help determine the cause of your symptoms and should be consulted if you experience a significant change in your symptoms.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis/" class="faqquestion">How is UC diagnosed?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Your doctor will usually suspect the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis based on your symptoms, but confirmation of the diagnosis requires testing.  Blood work is often checked to look for markers of inflammation or anemia (low red blood cell count), though these tests can be normal in patients with mild disease.  Tests of your stool to look for evidence of an intestinal infection are often obtained.  Radiologic images, including x-rays and CT scans, are usually not recommended but may be performed.  All patients with symptoms consistent with UC should have a colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy to confirm the diagnosis, assuming they are healthy enough to undergo the procedure.  During this procedure, your gastroenterologist will be able to directly examine the lining of your colon and rectum to look for evidence of inflammation and take small biopsies (pieces of colon tissue) to be examined under a microscope to look for the cause of the inflammation. </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis/" class="faqquestion">What causes UC?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The way in which patients get ulcerative colitis is still poorly understood.  There seems to be an interaction between the unique genetic makeup of an individual, environmental factors, and a patientâs specific immune system that triggers the disease.  UC is not an infection that can be passed from person to person.  Men and women are equally affected by UC.</p> 
<p>UC is more common in first degree relatives (siblings, parents, and children) of patients affected by UC, and up to 20% of patients will have an affected family member.  Despite the influence of genetics, the majority of patients with UC do not pass the disease to their children. Cases of ulcerative colitis have been identified throughout the world.  Those living in Northern climates and those of Jewish descent are at higher risk of developing UC. </p>
<p>Individuals having their appendix removed prior to the age of 20 appear to be at lower risk of developing UC.  No specific infectious agent has been linked to UC, and diet, breast feeding, and various medications have also been examined, but none have been found to cause UC.</p>
<p>It has been observed that smokers have lower rates of UC than non-smokers.  Furthermore, those who smoke and have UC tend to have a milder course of UC than those who do not smoke (note that this is the exact opposite effect that smoking has on Crohnâs disease).  Despite the protective role smoking appears to have on the development and natural history of UC, it is not recommended that patients start smoking to prevent UC due to the fact that there are so many other illnesses and cancers for which smoking is a definite risk factor. </p> 
<p>UC is an immune-mediated disease in which there is loss of control of the normal bowel immune activity and the ongoing activity results in damage to the bowel wall. 
</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis/" class="faqquestion">What are the possible complications of UC?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The complications of ulcerative colitis can be divided into those affecting the colon and those occurring outside of the colon.  Within the colon, UC can rarely lead to toxic megacolon or colon cancer.</p>
<p>Toxic megacolon describes a severe disease flare with a high risk of infection and colonic perforation (holes in the colon).  Patients may occasionally present with toxic megacolon as their initial presentation of UC and this complication requires hospitalization and may lead to surgery to remove the colon (colectomy). </p>
<p>UC is known to increase the risk of colon cancer.  Those patients who have had UC for a long time and those with more of their colon affected are at higher risk of developing colon cancer.  In general, patients begin to have an increased risk of colorectal cancer eight years after the onset of disease symptoms and should have colonoscopy every one or two years starting at this time. Colon cancer is a rare complication and it is thought that it may be preventable based on control of inflammation of the colon and careful colonoscopy examinations that look for any pre-cancerous changes called dysplasia. Overall, the risk of colon cancer increases 0.5% yearly after 10 years of disease though patients with inflammation throughout their colon may be at higher risk. Those patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are at the greatest risk for colon cancer and need to start screening upon diagnosis. </p>
<p>Patients with UC are also at risk for extra-intestinal manifestations of UC (complications outside of the colon).  These complications most frequently involve the liver, skin, eyes, mouth, and joints.  Within the liver, patients with UC may develop primary sclerosing cholangitis. This occurs in about 3% of patients with UC.  PSC can progress even if UC is not active and it is often detected by elevations in liver blood tests and confirmed by the use of MRI scans such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). </p>  
<p>Patients with UC can develop sores in the mouth or rashes on the skin that generally only appear when UC colon symptoms are active.  The most common rashes that are seen in UC are erythema nodosum (EN) and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG).  EN usually presents as a red, raised, painful area most commonly on the legs and is most often seen during flares of UC.  PG also presents as raised lesions on the skin (most frequently on the legs) that often develop after trauma to the skin and can lead to the formation of ulcers.  Unlike in EN, the appearance of skin lesions in PG may or may not mirror the activity of bowel symptoms.  The eyes can become red and painful (uveitis) and vision problems should be reported to your doctor. </p>  
<p>Arthritis is commonly associated with UC and can affect either small (such as the fingers/toes) or large joints (often the knees), though involvement of the smaller joints may have a course that is not related to activity in the colon.  The joints of the spine can be affected as well, though this is less common than it is in Crohnâs disease. </p>  
<p>As in other chronic medical conditions, anxiety and depression are common in patients with UC.  The unpredictability of UC and the need to take medications on a daily basis can lead to feelings of frustration or anger.  Though occasional feelings of frustration can be normal, feelings of significant anxiety or depression should be brought to the attention of your physician.  There are many support opportunities available for those having trouble coping with UC (see the final section). </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis/" class="faqquestion">What is the clinical course of UC?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Ulcerative colitis can present in a variety of ways. UC is often a chronic, life-long condition.  It most often is diagnosed in the second and third decades of life (ages 11-30), although it can be diagnosed at any age.  The initial presentation can be mild and is sometimes confused with other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, or it can be very severe and require hospitalization and surgery.  For most patients, UC tends to follow a course marked by periods of disease activity followed by variable periods during which a patient is symptom free.  Some patients may have continuous disease activity.  Rarely, a patient will have only a single disease flare.  In general, those people with a severe first attack of UC, people who are a younger age at diagnosis, and those whose entire colon is affected by UC tend to have a more aggressive course with more frequent flares and shorter periods of remission.  Despite the chronic nature of UC, most patients are able to function well and the life expectancy of a patient with UC is normal.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis/" class="faqquestion">How is UC treated?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Medical treatment of ulcerative colitis generally focuses on two separate goals: the induction of remission (making a sick person well) and the maintenance of remission (keeping a well person from getting sick again).  Surgery is also a treatment option for UC and will be discussed separately.  Medication choices can be grouped into four general categories: aminosalicylates, steroids, immunomodulators, and biologics.</p>
<p>Aminosalicylates are a group of anti-inflammatory medications (sulfasalazine, mesalamine, olsalazine, and balsalazide) used for both the induction and maintenance of remission in mild to moderate UC.  These medications are available in both oral and rectal formulations and work on the lining of the colon to decrease inflammation.  They are generally well-tolerated.  The most common side effects include nausea and rash.  Rectal formulations of mesalamine (enemas and suppositories) are generally used for those patients with disease at the end of their colon. </p>
<p>Steroids (prednisone, methylprednisolone and budesonide) are an effective medication for the induction of remission in moderate to severe UC, and are available in oral, rectal, and intravenous (IV) forms.  Steroids are absorbed into the bloodstream and have a number of severe side effects that make them unsuitable for chronic use to maintain remission.  These side effects include cataracts, osteoporosis, mood effects, an increased susceptibility to infection, high blood pressure, weight gain, and an underactive adrenal gland.  Budesonide tends to cause fewer steroid side-effects than prednisone.</p>
<p>Immunomodulators include medications such as 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine. These are taken in pill form and absorbed into the bloodstream.  They are effective for maintenance of remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, but are slow to work and can take up to 2-3 months to reach their peak effect.  Because of this, these medications are often combined with other medications (such as steroids) in patients who are very ill.  These medications require frequent blood work, as they can cause liver test abnormalities and low white blood cell counts, both of which are reversible when the medication is stopped.  Adverse reactions can include nausea, rash, liver and bone marrow toxicity, pancreatitis, and, rarely, lymphoma.</p>
<p>Biologic agents are medications given by injection that are used to treat moderate to severe UC. There are two classes of biologic agents that are approved for use in UC. The first class of medications works on an inflammatory molecule called tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and is commonly called anti-TNF agents. Anti-TNF drugs approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis include infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab. Infliximab is administered by IV infusion generally every eight weeks while adalimumab is a subcutaneous injection every two weeks and golimumab is a subcutaneous injection every four weeks. Side effects of these medications include infusion or injection site reactions and allergic hypersensitivity reactions. There are rare risks of serious infections with these medications. These medications lower oneâs immune system response so your doctor should perform a skin test or blood test for latent tuberculosis and a blood test for hepatitis B before starting a biologic drug.  Lymphoma is a rare risk of these therapies.  Combination therapy with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine and biologics increases the risk of a particularly rare type of lymphoma called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma.   The second class of biologic medications, called integrin inhibitors, works on receptors called integrins, which control the trafficking of white blood cells to the intestine.  The only currently approved integrin inhibitor for ulcerative colitis is called vedolizumab, which is administered as an IV infusion every eight weeks. Side effects include infusion reactions, increased susceptibility to infections, and slightly increased risk of lymphoma or other malignancies. As with all medications, you should discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.</p>
<p>Other medications used less frequently for UC include cyclosporine and tacrolimus.  These agents are sometimes used in those rare cases of severe UC that are not responsive to steroids.  Side effects of these agents include infections and kidney problems.  These agents are offered at a limited number of hospitals and are usually used for a short period of time as a bridge to other maintenance therapies such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. </p>  
<p>No matter which medical therapy you and your doctor decide upon, adherence to the prescribed course is essential.  No medical therapy can work if it is not taken and failure to take your medications can lead to unnecessary escalation of therapy if it is not brought to the attention of your doctor.  Because many of the complications associated with UC are related to ongoing disease activity, good medication adherence may minimize these risks. </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis/" class="faqquestion">What is the role of surgery?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Surgery in ulcerative colitis is performed for a number of reasons and is generally considered to be curative if the entire large intestine is removed.  Patients who do not respond to medications, are concerned about or have unacceptable side effects from medications, develop toxic megacolon, dysplasia (precancerous lesions) or cancer, or are children who are not growing because of UC are often considered for surgery.  Several different surgeries are performed for UC and the choice of surgery is dependent on patient preference and the experience of the surgeon.  The most common surgery is total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (total removal of the colon and rectum with creation of a pseudo-rectum from a portion of the small intestine).  This operation usually requires two separate surgeries to be completed, although it may require three stages in severely ill patients.  Following this surgery, patients can expect 5-10 stools daily, as they no longer have a colon to store stool.  Patients usually feel better because their sense of stool urgency improves, they no longer have bleeding, and their medications can often be stopped.  However, these patients are at risk for post-operative inflammation of the pouch known as pouchitis, which is usually treated with antibiotics. Women who have this surgery may have decreased ability to get pregnant naturally. </p>  

<p>Another common surgical procedure involves a proctocolectomy with ileostomy (removal of the entire colon and rectum, and connection of the small intestine to the abdominal wall so that stool empties into a bag).  This procedure is often undertaken in elderly patients, obese patients or those with anal dysfunction.  Should you need a surgical procedure for UC, your surgeon can help you decide which type of surgery best fits your needs. </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis/" class="faqquestion">Do complementary and alternative therapies work in UC?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Outside of the standard medical therapies discussed for ulcerative colitis, many alternative therapies have been studied.  No studies have suggested that diet can either cause or treat UC and there is no specific diet that patients with UC should follow, though it is advisable to eat a balanced diet.  Likewise, there is no convincing evidence that UC results from food allergies.  Though vitamin and mineral deficiencies are more common in Crohnâs disease, specific deficiencies can occur in UC patients.  For this reason, a multivitamin and a calcium supplement are not unreasonable.  Malnutrition can become a concern in severe UC. </p>

<p>Probiotics are species of bacteria that are thought to have beneficial properties for the bowel.  There are a number of scientific studies that, have been performed to assess the role of probiotics in UC, and most of these have not shown benefit.  There is some evidence, however, that a specific probiotic (VSL #3) may be helpful as an additive to other therapies for maintenance of remission. </p>    

<p>Various other herbal remedies and alternative therapies have been studied for use in patients with IBD, such as curcumin (a derivative of the herb tumeric) and parasitic worms (helminths).  Though limited studies have shown promise for a number of alternative therapies, these have not yet been shown to be safe and effective, and are not currently recommended.  Studies of homeopathic compounds are currently ongoing and will hopefully provide novel treatments for use in UC in the future. </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis/" class="faqquestion">What type of follow-up is required?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>As mentioned earlier, ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease, and establishing a long-term relationship with a gastroenterologist experienced in the treatment of UC is advisable.  Many medications used in UC require regular blood work to ensure that they are not causing any serious side effects.  Patients with UC have a higher risk of osteoporosis associated with both underlying disease activity and long-term or frequent steroid use.  Because of this risk, doctors may recommend measurement of vitamin D blood levels and a bone mineral density screening with a DEXA scan.  Female patients on steroids or other immunosuppressive medications are more likely to have abnormal pap smears and should have regular cervical cancer screening. All patients with ulcerative colitis receiving immunomodulator or biologic therapy should have annual skin exams to screen for non-melanoma skin cancers. Immunizations are very important to prevent infection. All UC patients should receive pneumococcal and influenza vaccines. Live vaccines (such as MMR, polio, and varicella) should be avoided if your immune system is suppressed by UC medication. Colorectal cancer screening is also important because of the higher risk of cancer in patients with UC, as discussed earlier. </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ulcerative-colitis/" class="faqquestion">Where can you get more information?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Many organizations provide support and information for patients with ulcerative colitis. The ACG website (<a href="http://www.gi.org/">gi.org</a>) has additional information. The Crohnâs and Colitis Foundation of America (<a href="http://www.ccfa.org/" target="_blank">www.ccfa.org</a>) has extensive patient information along with links to various different social, financial, and medical support groups.  Other sources of information include the individual drug company websites, and, most importantly, your personal physician.</p>

<p>The two most common types of peptic ulcer are called  âgastric ulcersâ and âduodenal ulcersâ. These names refer to the location where  the ulcer is found. Gastric ulcers are located in the stomach (see Figure 1). Duodenal  ulcers are found at the beginning of the small intestine (also called the small  bowel) known as the duodenum. A person may have both gastric and duodenal  ulcers at the same time.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Many people with ulcers have  no symptoms at all. Some people with an ulcer have belly pain. This pain is  often in the upper abdomen. Sometimes food makes the pain better, and sometimes  it makes it worse. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, or feeling bloated  or full. It is important to know that there are many causes of abdominal pain,  so not all pain in the abdomen is an âulcerâ.</p>
<p>The most important symptoms  that ulcers cause are related to bleeding. </p>
<p>Bleeding from an ulcer can be  slow and go unnoticed or can cause life-threatening hemorrhage. Ulcers that  bleed slowly might not produce the symptoms until the person becomes anemic. Symptoms  of anemia include fatigue, shortness of breath with exercise and pale skin  color.</p>
<p>Bleeding that occurs more rapidly might show up as  melena â jet black, very sticky stool (often compared to âroof tarâ) â or even  a large amount of dark red or maroon blood in the stool. People with bleeding  ulcers may also vomit. This vomit may be red blood or may look like âcoffee  groundsâ. Other symptoms might include âpassing outâ or feeling lightheaded. Symptoms  of rapid bleeding represent a medical emergency. If this occurs, immediate  medical attention is needed. People with these symptoms should dial 911 or go  to the nearest emergency room.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

		<wp:postmeta>
			<wp:meta_key><![CDATA[_acg_gi_patients_cpt_basics_sectioncontent_3]]></wp:meta_key>
			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The two most important causes  of ulcers are infection with <em>Helicobacter  pylori </em>and a group of medications known as NSAIDs.</p>
<p><em>Helicobacter pylori</em> (also called <em>H. pylori</em> or âHP)  is a bacterium that lives in the stomach of infected people. The understanding  that <em>H. pylori</em> can cause ulcers was  one of the most important medical discoveries of the late 20th century.  In fact, Dr. Barry Marshall and Dr. J. Robin Warren  were awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery. </p>
<p>People infected with <em>H. pylori</em> are at increased risk of  developing peptic ulcers. When a person is diagnosed with an ulcer, testing for <em>H. pylori</em> is often done. There are a  number of tests to diagnose <em>H. pylori</em> and the type of test used depends on the situation.</p>
  <p>People with ulcers. who are  infected with <em>H. pylori.</em> should have  their infection treated. Treatment usually consists of taking either three or  four drugs. The drug therapy will use acid suppression therapy with a proton  pump inhibitor (PPI) along with antibiotic therapy and perhaps a bismuth  containing agent such as Pepto-Bismol. <em>H.  pylori</em> can be very difficult to cure; so it is very important that people  being treated for this infection take their entire course of antibiotics as  prescribed.</p>
  <p>NSAIDs (<u>N</u>on-<u>S</u>teroidal <u>A</u>nti-<u>I</u>nflammatory <u>D</u>rugs) are a group of medications  typically used to treat pain. There are many drugs in this group. A few of  these include: aspirin (Bayer<sup>Â®</sup>), ibuprofen (Motrin<sup>Â®</sup>,  Advil<sup>Â®</sup>), naproxen (Aleve<sup>Â®</sup>, Naprosyn<sup>Â®</sup>),  ketorolac (Toradol<sup>Â®</sup>) and oxaprozin (Daypro<sup>Â®</sup>). NSAIDs are  also included in some combination medications, such as Alka-Seltzer<sup>Â®</sup>,  Goodyâs Powder<sup>Â®</sup> and BC Powder<sup>Â®</sup>.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen (Tylenol<sup>Â®</sup>)  is NOT an NSAID and is therefore the preferred non-prescription treatment for  pain in patients at risk for peptic ulcer disease.</p>
<p>NSAID use is very common  because many are available over the counter without a prescriptionand therefore  they are a very common cause of peptic ulcers. NSAIDs cause ulcers by  interrupting the natural ability of the stomach and the duodenum to protect  themselves from stomach acid. NSAIDs also can interfere with blood clotting,  which has obvious importance when ulcers bleed.</p>
  <p>People who take NSAIDs for a  long time and/or at high doses, have a higher risk of developing ulcers. These  people should discuss the various options for preventing ulcers with their  physician. Some people are given an acid suppressing PPI. These drugs can  prevent or significantly reduce the risk of an ulcer being caused by NSAIDs.</p>
<p>There are many myths about peptic ulcers. Ulcers are <u>not</u> caused by emotional âstressâ or by worrying. They are <u>not</u> caused by  spicy foods or a rich diet. Certain foods might irritate an ulcer that is  already there, however, the food is not the cause of the ulcer. People  diagnosed with ulcers <u>do not</u> need to follow a specific diet. The days of  ulcer patients surviving on a bland diet are a thing of the past.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The most typical way for  ulcers to be diagnosed is by a procedure called an EGD. EGD stands for <u>E</u>sophago<u>G</u>astro<u>D</u>uodenoscopy.  An EGD (also called âupper endoscopyâ) is performed by inserting a special  lighted camera on a flexible tube into the personâs mouth to look directly into  the stomach and the beginning of the small bowel. This flexible camera carefully  inspects the most likely areas for ulcers to be located. Ulcers identified  during an EGD may be photographed, biopsied and even treated, if bleeding is  present.</p>
<p>Another way ulcers were  diagnosed in the past was with an x-ray test called an âupper GI seriesâ. An  upper GI series involves drinking a white chalky substance called barium, and  then taking a number of x-rays to look at the lining of the stomach. Doctors  can see the ulcers on the x-rays when they have barium in them. </p>
<p>Today, the preferred method for diagnosing ulcers is  with an EGD given the flexible camera is better able to detect even small  ulcers and because it allows for potential treatment at that time if the ulcer  is bleeding. An upper GI series can miss small ulcers and also does not allow  direct treatment of an ulcer.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The way that ulcers are  treated depends on a number of features. Nearly all peptic ulcers will be  treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). PPIs are powerful acid blocking  drugs that can be taken as a pill or given in an IV. Often, the potent IV form  is used if a patient is hospitalized with a bleeding ulcer. There are six PPIs  available in the United States. These are omeprazole (Prilosec<sup>Â®</sup>,  Zegerid<sup>Â®</sup>), lansoprazole (Prevacid<sup>Â®</sup>), pantoprazole  (Protonix<sup>Â®</sup>), rabeprazole (Aciphex<sup>Â®</sup>), esomeprazole (Nexium<sup>Â®</sup>),  and dexlansoprazole (Dexilant<sup>Â®</sup>). There are very few medical differences  between these drugs.</p>
<p>PPIs require a meal to  activate them. Patients should eat a meal within 30 minutes to 1 hour after taking this  medication for the acid suppression therapy to work most effectively. Waiting  later than this time can decrease the positive effect of this medication. This  might delay healing or even result in the failure of the ulcer to heal.</p>
<p>Sometimes duodenal ulcers  (not gastric ulcers) will be treated with H2 blockers. H2 blockers are another  type of acid reducing medication. Common H2 blockers are ranitidine (Zantac<sup>Â®</sup>),  cimetidine (Tagamet<sup>Â®</sup>), famotidine (Pepcid<sup>Â®</sup>) and  nizatidine (Axid<sup>Â®</sup>).</p>
<p>An important part in treating  ulcers is by identifying what caused them Patients with ulcers caused by  NSAIDs should talk to their doctor about other medications that can be used to  treat pain. </p>
<p>If the person is infected with <em>H. pylori</em> this infection  should be treated. Completing the full dose of antibiotics is very important. Just  as important, is making sure that the infection is gone. There are number of  ways to do this. Generally, a blood test is not a good way to test if the  infection is gone. The doctor who treated the infection can recommend the best  way to do the âtest of cureâ. </p>
<p>When someone has an ulcer  that has bled significantly, treatment might be done at the time of EGD. There  are a number of techniques that can be performed during an EGD to control  bleeding from an ulcer. The gastroenterologist might inject medications, use a  catheter to cauterize the ulcer (burn a bleeding vessel shut) or place a small  clip to clamp off a bleeding vessel. Not all ulcers need to be treated this  way. The doctor doing the EGD will decide if treatment is indicated based on  the way the ulcer looks. The doctor will usually treat an ulcer that is  actually bleeding when it is seen and will also often treat other ulcers if  they have a certain appearance. These findings are sometimes called âstigmata  of recent hemorrhageâ or just âstigmataâ. Stigmata will usually get treated  during the EGD if they are classified as high-risk. Common high-risk findings  include a âvisible vesselâ and an âadherent clotâ.</p>
<p>Most ulcers can be treated  and will heal. Often, people with ulcers will have to take PPIs for several  weeks to heal an ulcer. It is also important to correct what caused the ulcer. When  possible, NSAIDs should be stopped. Patients with ulcers caused by NSAIDs  should talk to their doctor about other medications that can be used to treat  pain.</p>

<p>People with gastric ulcers  (only in the stomach) usually have another EGD several weeks after treatment to  make sure that the ulcer is gone. This is because a very small number of  gastric ulcers might contain cancer. Duodenal ulcers (at the beginning of the  small intestine) usually donât need to be looked at again.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

<p><strong>Duodenal</strong> â  referring to the beginning of the small intestine or duodenum.</p>
<p><strong>EGD</strong> â <u>E</u>sophago<u>G</u>astro<u>D</u>uodenoscopy,  also called âupper endoscopyâ is a medical procedure where a flexible lighted  tube with a camera is inserted through the personâs mouth and into the stomach  and duodenum to diagnose or treat disease.</p>
<p><strong>Erosion</strong> â a  very shallow sore, similar to an abrasion or a scrape. These are usually not  very important and very rarely cause symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Gastric</strong> â  referring to the stomach.</p>
<p><strong>H2 blocker</strong> â  H2 blockers significantly lower the production of acid in the stomach. They are  sometimes used to treat duodenal (not gastric) ulcers. They are also often used  to treat heartburn and GERD. Common H2 blockers are ranitidine (Zantac<sup>Â®</sup>),  cimetidine (Tagamet<sup>Â®</sup>), famotidine (Pepcid<sup>Â®</sup>) and  nizatidine (Axid<sup>Â®</sup>).</p>
<p><strong><em>Helicobacter pylori</em></strong> â sometimes called <em>H. pylori</em> or HP is a bacterium that causes ulcers. <em>H. pylori</em> is also a risk factor for  stomach cancer. If prescribed, it is very important to complete an entire  course of antibiotics for <em>H. pylori</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Melena</strong> â  black very sticky stool, often compared to roof tar. This is a common symptom  of a bleeding ulcer. Black stool that looks like melena can be caused by taking  iron medications and by drugs like Pepto-Bismol<sup>Â®</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>NSAIDs</strong> - (<u>N</u>on-<u>S</u>teroidal <u>A</u>nti-<u>I</u>nflammatory <u>D</u>rugs) are a group of medications  typically used to treat pain. There are many drugs in this group. A few of  these include: aspirin (Bayer<sup>Â®</sup>), ibuprofen (Motrin<sup>Â®</sup>,  Advil<sup>Â®</sup>), naproxen (Aleve<sup>Â®</sup>, Naprosyn<sup>Â®</sup>),  ketorolac (Toradol<sup>Â®</sup>) and oxaprozin (Daypro<sup>Â®</sup>). NSAIDs are  also included in some combination medications, such as Alka-Seltzer<sup>Â®</sup>.  Acetaminophen (Tylenol<sup>Â®</sup>) is NOT an NSAID and is therefore the  preferred non-prescription treatment for pain in patients at risk for peptic  ulcer disease.</p>
<p><strong>Peptic</strong> â  caused by acid.</p>
<p><strong>PPIs</strong> â <u>P</u>roton <u>P</u>ump <u>I</u>nhibitors. Powerful acid blocking drugs that can be taken  as a pill or given in an IV. PPIs are frequently used to treat ulcers, and also  heartburn and GERD. There are six PPIs available in the United States. These  are omeprazole (Prilosec<sup>Â®</sup>, Zegerid<sup>Â®</sup>), lansoprazole  (Prevacid<sup>Â®</sup>), pantoprazole (Protonix<sup>Â®</sup>), rabeprazole  (Aciphex<sup>Â®</sup>), esomeprazole (Nexium<sup>Â®</sup>) and dexlansoprazole  (Dexilant<sup>Â®</sup>). There are very few medical differences between these  drugs. It is important to know that PPIs require a meal to activate them. Patients  should  eat a meal within 30 minutes to 1 hour after taking this medication for the  acid suppression therapy to work properly.</p>
<p><strong>Stigmata of recent hemorrhage</strong> â sometimes just called âstigmataâ are findings  during an EGD that indicate a higher risk of bleeding or re-bleeding. Stigmata  are usually treated during the EGD when they are found. This treatment reduces  the chance of bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>Ulcer</strong> â an open sore. Ulcers are deeper than erosions.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

What is Eosinophilic Esophagitis?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Eosinophilic esophagitis (also known as EoE) is a disease characterized by the presence of a large number of a special type of white blood cell, the eosinophil, that can cause inflammation in the esophagus. This inflammation can lead to stiffening or narrowing of the esophagus, which can lead to difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or food getting stuck in the esophagus. Reflux of stomach acid contents into the esophagus can also cause eosinophils as well as inflammation in the esophagus. In EoE, the eosinophils are present even after acid reflux has been treated. Although eosinophils may be found in the rest of the gastrointestinal tract in a healthy person, when present in the esophagus, this usually suggests an abnormal condition. While other illnesses such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), parasitic diseases or inflammatory bowel disease may cause eosinophils in the esophagus, EoE is the most common cause of large numbers of eosinophils in the esophagus.</p></div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/eosinophilic-esophagitis/" class="faqquestion">How common is EoE in adults?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>While EoE was previously thought to be a rare disease, it has recently been recognized as one of the most common causes of difficulty swallowing and food impaction in young adults. This has become a global trend with increased cases of EoE being reported from five continents. The cause for this rise is likely a combination of increasing occurrences of EoE and a growing awareness of the condition among gastroenterologists, allergists and pathologists. It is thought that the disease may be increasing similar to the increases seen in other allergic disorders such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. Estimated occurrences of this condition in adults may be as high as 1-3 per 10,000 people, based on information from patients in Australia and Switzerland. Although some studies suggest that the disease is more common in the Caucasian population, cases have been seen in patients of African American, Asian and Hispanic descent. EoE affects males three times more often than females.</p></div>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The most common presenting symptoms in adults are difficulty swallowing solid food and food impactions in which food gets lodged in the esophagus and is unable to pass into the stomach. If patients develop a food impaction, an endoscopy is often needed to help relieve this obstruction. Most adults with symptoms are between the ages of 20 to 40, although there have been cases of adults presenting at much later ages. Other less common symptoms include heartburn and chest pain.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/eosinophilic-esophagitis/" class="faqquestion">How is EoE diagnosed?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Currently, the only way to diagnose this condition is by performing an upper endoscopy with biopsy (taking tiny pieces of tissue) of the esophagus. During endoscopy, a thin, flexible tube with a camera, which allows the doctor to see the inside of your esophagus, is inserted into the esophagus while the patient is sedated (sleep caused by medication). Biopsies taken from the lining of the esophagus (mucosa) are later inspected under a microscope by a pathologist for characteristic changes of EoE. These changes include large numbers of eosinophils in the superficial portion of the tissue biopsy and signs of inflammation in the tissue. Sometimes scaring or fibrosis can be seen in the deeper portions of the tissue. In EoE, the eosinophils are limited to the esophagus and are not present in the stomach or duodenum.</p>
<p>Usually, there are characteristic features that the gastroenterologist can see in the esophagus of patients with EoE. These include linear furrows or creases in the esophagus and concentric rings of the superficial layer of the esophagus. Other features, including narrow esophagus, white spots on the esophageal tissue and short, very narrow segments of the esophagus called strictures, may also be seen. While these changes are suggestive of EoE, their presence alone does not diagnose the condition. The esophagus can also appear normal in adult patients with EoE.</p>
<p>Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) such as heartburn or regurgitation can overlap with symptoms of EoE. Since gastroesophageal reflux disease is much more common than EoE in the adult population and can also be a cause of eosinophils in the esophagus, it is important to distinguish the two. Therefore, if eosinophils are found on a tissue biopsy of the esophagus, it is suggested that the patient start treatment with acid reducers to see if the eosinophils go away once the reflux is treated. This requires another endoscopy. If the eosinophils are still in the tissue after reflux has been treated, then the patient most likely has EoE. Another method to identify if acid in the esophagus is contributing to the eosinophils is to complete a test called an esophageal pH test. In this test, a very thin tube is placed through the nose into the esophagus and stomach, or a temporary sensor is placed in the esophagus via endoscopy. Both allow levels of acid in the esophagus to be monitored for a period of time, usually 24 - 72 hours. If this test shows high levels of acid in the esophagus, it suggests that GERD may be the cause of the eosinophils in the esophagus. In more complicated situations, some patients have both GERD and EoE and therefore will need to have treatment for both conditions.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/eosinophilic-esophagitis/" class="faqquestion">What is the cause of EoE?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Currently the cause of EoE in adults has not been clearly identified. Some studies have suggested an allergic reaction to environmental and food allergens. There may also be a genetic cause that may lead to EoE in some patients. A recent study has identified an increase in a gene coding for a protein called eotaxin-3 in patients with EoE. Further support that there may be a genetic link is that some adults have a family history of allergic disorders and a family history of EoE.</p>
<p>A history of allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, eczema or food allergy has been seen in up to 70% of adults with EoE either by history or positive allergy testing. In one recent study, adults with EoE treated with dietary elimination improved their EoE, but recurrence of EoE happened when certain foods were added back to the diet. This suggests that food allergens play a role in some adults with EoE.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/eosinophilic-esophagitis/" class="faqquestion">What are the most common treatments for EoE in adults?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Currently, there is no one accepted therapy for all patients with EoE. Although dietary therapy is the most common treatment of pediatric EoE, this has not been widely accepted among gastroenterologists who treat adult patients. Many adult patients are initially treated with acid-blocking medications to rule out GERD. If this does not improve symptoms or tissue changes of the eosinophils, then steroids taken using an asthma inhaler, but swallowed rather than inhaled by the patient, have been tried with good, although limited results. This treatment tends to be well tolerated; side-effects of a fungal infection called thrush or candida of the esophagus are relatively rare.</p>
<p>Dietary treatment may consist of an elemental diet, a "six-food-elimination diet" or a targeted-elimination diet, usually for six weeks. After this point, if the disease improves, foods are reintroduced one at a time to help identify the food trigger. An elemental diet is another potential treatment. It is an amino-acid based formula, taken usually for six weeks. Elemental formula can have a poor taste and can be costly; therefore, a six-food-elimination diet is preferred by most patients. A six-food-elimination diet is a diet that contains no milk, soy, egg, wheat, nuts or seafood. These foods are the most common food allergens found in patients with EoE. A targeted-elimination diet is a diet that is based on eliminating foods found to be positive on allergy testing.</p>
<p>Dietary therapy has been shown to be helpful in some adults with EoE and may be tried with motivated (willing to follow through with food avoidance) patients under the care of an experienced provider or dietician.</p>
<p>If patients do not respond to medical therapy or diet exclusion, an esophageal dilation or "stretching" is sometimes performed if there is narrowing of the esophagus. Although dilation may be helpful in the short term, repeated dilations may be needed to control symptoms. Because dilation alone does not affect the underlying inflammation in the esophagus, this procedure is usually performed in patients who are also being treated with medical or dietary therapy. The risks of esophageal dilation include chest pain after the procedure and in rare cases a perforation or tear of the esophagus. While dilation can be performed safely, it must be done with caution and is almost always performed after a trial of medical or dietary therapy has failed.</p>
</div></li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/eosinophilic-esophagitis/" class="faqquestion">What is the long term consequence of having EoE?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>There is limited information about the natural history of this disease in adults. Current studies suggest that it is a chronic, reoccurring condition. Patients have continued symptoms, although esophageal eosinophil levels may change over time. Complications, including esophageal strictures and food impactions, may occur. In very rare cases, forceful vomiting, prolonged food impactions and esophageal dilations may result in a perforation or tear of the esophagus which needs immediate medical attention. Currently treatment of EoE is directed at controlling symptoms, reducing eosinophil levels in the tissue, and preventing complications of the disease, such as food impactions.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/probiotics-for-the-treatment-of-adult-gastrointestinal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">
What are Probiotics?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Probiotics are currently defined by the World Health Organization as "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer health benefits on the host." There are trillions of bacteria which live in our digestive tracts. More than 400 different species have been identified. Most of these are healthy bacteria while others have the potential to cause damage to our intestinal systems. The good bacteria keep the bad bacteria in check by limiting the unhealthy bacteria's ability to increase in numbers. The good bacteria can also secrete chemicals which break down toxins produced by the bad bacteria, and activate the immune system to help fight the bad bacteria. At times, an imbalance between the good and bad bacteria can lead to uncomfortable symptoms or illnesses, and simply put, probiotics are bacteria or yeast which may alleviate these common medical symptoms and illnesses. They are found in many commercial products including yogurt, juices, soy products, fermented milk, tempeh and other dietary supplements. They also come in capsule, tablet or powder formulations. In the United States there has been a significant increase in use of probiotics to promote general as well as gastrointestinal health.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/probiotics-for-the-treatment-of-adult-gastrointestinal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">How do Probiotics Work?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Probiotic supplements are specifically formulated to assure that the bacteria are able to survive the acid environment of the stomach, attach to the cells of, and colonize the small intestine and/or colon. While the specific effects of each probiotic species likely differs, in general, these organisms have been shown to confer health benefits through a variety of mechanisms. Some have the ability to populate or modify the surrounding environment so that bad bacteria are unable to colonize or survive in the intestines. Many species release chemicals which break down the damaging toxins produced by unhealthy bacteria causing illnesses such as diarrhea. Some increase the number of infection-fighting cells in the gastrointestinal tract, while others have the ability to stop bad bacteria or their byproducts from leaving the gastrointestinal tract and entering the rest of the body. A few have been shown to modify pain perceptions.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/probiotics-for-the-treatment-of-adult-gastrointestinal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">Are All Probiotic Preparations Basically the Same?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>No. In fact it is important to note that most probiotics differ both in their bacterial composition and quantity. There are more than 100 commercially available probiotic supplements. Many of these are single species preparations while others contain either multiple strains of a single species, multiple species, or both. Furthermore, the concentration of bacteria in each preparation varies. Some contain hundreds of colonies while others billions. There is no evidence to support the claim that either preparations with multiple species/strains or higher concentrations of bacteria leads to improved symptom resolution. Furthermore, prior scientific testing has revealed that individual gastrointestinal illnesses respond differently to the various probiotic products. It is therefore essential that formal testing of individual preparations be performed and proof of beneficial effects identified for each specific digestive disorder.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/probiotics-for-the-treatment-of-adult-gastrointestinal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">How do I Know Which Probiotic to Consume for My Particular Gastrointestinal Illness?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The best way to identify an appropriate supplement is to consult with your primary care doctor or gastroenterologist. Many of the probiotics available for purchase have never been scientifically tested and are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Thus, there is no way to determine whether or not the supplement is beneficial or if the product is safe. Therefore, it is difficult for individuals to identify appropriate products for their specific sets of symptoms or diagnosed clinical illnesses. Many trials have been performed assessing the benefits of probiotics for treating gastrointestinal illnesses. Some have identified beneficial preparations for treating individual disorders, while others have yielded conflicting results. Overall, there is general agreement that the data from these studies has to be interpreted in the context of each individual disorder. The following are disorders with studies suggesting potential benefits for probiotics.</p>
<p><strong>Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):</strong>Â IBS has been one of the most extensively studied disorders with multipleÂ <em>Bifidobacterium</em>Â andÂ <em>Lactobacillus</em>Â species tested both individually and in combination. More than 20 randomized controlled trials have been completed. Recently, two groups of experts evaluated all of the available data and while the reviews were performed independently, similar conclusions were reached: The use of the single strain probioticÂ <em>Bifidobacterium infantis</em>Â 35624 appears beneficial for treating IBS.</p>
<p><strong>Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea (AAD):</strong>Â More than 25 trials and comprehensive reviews have suggested that the risk of AAD can be reduced by 50-60% if probiotics are co-administered with antibiotics. The individual probiotic strains found to be most effective includeÂ <em>Saccharomyces boulardii</em>Â (<em>S. boulardii</em>), a yeast, andÂ <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG</em>Â while many combinations of 2 or more bacteria have also proven beneficial. It does not appear that any of the aforementioned preparations have proven more efficacious than the others.</p>
<p><strong>Infectious Diarrhea:</strong>Â More than 60 studies on this topic have been published, the vast majority assessing infants and children. The data for the use of probiotics in this setting is limited by the variety and doses of organisms tested, the underlying infections and populations being treated. It appears as though probiotics have a modest effect by decreasing the overall number of diarrheal episodes, and reducing the duration of an infection by approximately 1 day. The vast majority of studies usedÂ <em>Lactobacillus</em>Â strains, and while a specific probiotic cannot be recommended, this genus appear most effective.</p>
<p><strong>Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea (CDAD):</strong>Â Data for the use of probiotics for the treatment of CDAD is limited, but they have been tested for both treatment and prevention. The strongest evidence suggests that adding the yeast S. boulardii to standard antimicrobial treatment may increase the likelihood of cure and reduce the rate of recurrence in patients experiencing mild repetitive CDAD infections. There is no evidence that the combination of a probiotic and antibiotic is effective in treating an initial CDAD infection, or that probiotics as single intervention therapies are beneficial in treating primary or recurrent CDAD. Patients who are considering using S. boulardii in combination with standard antibiotic therapy should do so judiciously and only with the recommendations of their physicians as this organism has the potential to leave the gastrointestinal tract, enter the bloodstream, and cause potentially life-threatening infections.</p>
<p><strong>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD):Â </strong>There is growing data suggesting that probiotics may be of some benefit in the treatment of two of three different IBD-related disorders: Ulcerative Colitis, and Pouchitis. The data for Crohnâs Disease is less convincing.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Crohn's Disease (CD):</strong>Â  Data supporting the use of probiotics for treating CD is limited.Â  Currently, there is no evidence that any single strain or combination probiotic alone or in combination with standard therapies is clinically effective for treating CD symptoms, improving chances for induction or maintenance of remission, or preventing relapses after surgery.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Ulcerative Colitis (UC): Â </strong>Strong evidence suggests that using the multi-strain probiotic preparation, VSL#3, a combination of 4 strains ofÂ <em>Lactobacillus</em>, 3 strains ofÂ <em>Bifidobacteria</em>andÂ <em>Streptococcus thermophilus</em>Â as an adjunct to standard therapy, has the potential to reduce symptoms and induce remission in patients with mild to moderate UC. Appropriate studies evaluating the benefits of probiotics as single therapies for inducing or maintaining remission are lacking.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Pouchitis</strong>:Â  Many patients need to undergo removal of their colon as a curative treatment for their UC. In these instances, the last part of the small intestine is sometimes used to create a reservoir, or pouch, where stool is collected before it is expelled from the body. Pouchitis is a condition where the pouch becomes inflamed resulting in multiple symptoms including the passage of blood or mucus or an increase in frequency or urge to go to the bathroom. Within the first year after surgery, pouchitis is identified in approximately 20% of patients and by five years, 50% of patients have developed this condition. Studies have shown that the bacteria in these pouches differ from those seen in the normal colon and it is surmised that these lead to the development of inflammation. This disorder is commonly treated with antibiotics, but the recurrence rate is high. Therefore, it makes sense that repopulating these pouches with healthy bacteria may alleviate symptoms. A single study revealed that VSL#3 given immediately after surgery reduces the chance of developing pouchitis in the first year. Two other small studies have shown that supplementation with VSL#3 after antibiotic treatment significantly decreases the likelihood of recurrence. Thus, limited data have shown benefits for VSL#3 in both the primary and secondary prevention of this disorder.</li>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>We do not know. Most patients have not been monitored for long enough periods of time subsequent to their participation in clinical trials. In some cases a loss of effect can occur quickly. For example, in the VSL#3 trial for pouchitis, a decrease in healthy bacteria in the pouch was identified within one month of discontinuing therapy. While there is nothing wrong with stopping probiotics and monitoring for symptom recurrence, many people choose to continue their supplements indefinitely.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/probiotics-for-the-treatment-of-adult-gastrointestinal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">Are Probiotics Safe?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>In general, probiotics are considered safe and many have been used for more than 100 years. However, these supplements are not regulated by the FDA and therefore no demonstration of safety is required prior to marketing them. Patients with chronic medical conditions or receiving treatment for acute or chronic infections should discuss using probiotics with their healthcare providers as there are scattered reports of specific strains causing severe illnesses in certain medical settings. For example, severalÂ <em>Lactobacillus</em>Â species andÂ <em>S. boulardii</em>Â have been shown to enter the bloodstream possibly causing severe life-threatening infections. Furthermore, in a study performed on patients with severe inflammation of the pancreas, the use of probiotics in attempts to decrease the risk of infection actually resulted in an increased risk of death. Overall, complications from probiotics are rare, but appear to occur more frequently in immunocompromised patients, or in patients with indwelling intravenous catheters, suffering from infections of the gastrointestinal tract, or who are sick enough to require hospitalization in an intensive care unit. Their use should be completely avoided in these situations. This includes patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis being treated with immune suppression. Discussion with your doctor about any supplements that you are considering is very important.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/probiotics-for-the-treatment-of-adult-gastrointestinal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">Are Probiotics the Same as Prebiotics?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>No. Prebiotics are non-digestible dietary compounds which promote the health of the beneficial bacteria. The majority of these products are carbohydrates such as soluble fibers or oligosaccharides found in onions, bananas, tomatoes, soy beans and other plants. It has been suggested that these products make their way through the digestive tract and stimulate the growth or activity of healthy bacteria naturally residing in the colon. In some instances prebiotics are added to probiotic supplements and these products are known as synbiotics.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/probiotics-for-the-treatment-of-adult-gastrointestinal-disorders/" class="faqquestion">What Questions Need Answering by Future Studies?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Given the limited amount of information available regarding probiotic use, numerous questions remain unanswered. More information is necessary regarding optimal dosages, durations of therapy, the efficacy and safety of individual and combination probiotics, continued response rates after withdrawal, and the benefits, or lack thereof, of adding prebiotics to consumer preparations. Each of these issues must be addressed not only for the supplements themselves, but also within the context of each specific disease state.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/non-cardiac-chest-pain/" class="faqquestion">What is non-cardiac chest pain?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is a term used to describe  chest pain that resembles heart pain (also called angina) in patients who do  not have heart disease. The pain typically is felt behind the breast bone  (sternum) and is described as oppressive, squeezing or pressure-like. It may  radiate to the neck, left arm or the back (the spine). It may be precipitated  by food intake. It lasts variable periods of time and it is not unusual for it  to last hours. Patients may also complain of associated reflux symptoms such as  heartburn (a burning feeling behind the breast bone) or fluid regurgitation (a sensation  of stomach juices coming back toward the chest and even to the mouth frequently  with a bitter or sour taste).</p>
<p>Because the pain is similar to heart pain (called angina),  patients and physicians frequently attribute this pain to the heart. In fact,  many patients present to emergency rooms concerned about a heart attack and  commonly undergo cardiac studies (such as EKGs, laboratory tests, stress test  and even coronary angiography â where dye is injected into the heart vessels).  After these cardiac tests fail to show evidence of heart disease, the patients  receive the diagnosis of NCCP, leading the physician to examine other causes  for this chest pain.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/non-cardiac-chest-pain/" class="faqquestion">Why is cardiac and NCCP similar?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The heart and the esophagus are located in the chest  cavity (thorax) in close proximity (Figure 1). They receive very similar nerve  supply. Thus, pain arising from either organ travel through the same nerve  sensory fibers to the brain. As a result, the pain from either organ can have  very similar features making it difficult to differentiate cardiac pain from  esophageal (swallowing pipe) pain. It also indicates that a very common source  of chest pain (non-cardiac) arises from the esophagus.</p>

<p align="center"><em>Figure 1. The heart and the esophagus are located in the chest in close proximity and also share same sensory nerves.</em></p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/non-cardiac-chest-pain/" class="faqquestion">Are there other names that this disorder goes by?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>A variety of names have also been used in describing  patients with NCCP. You may hear your doctor or other health care professional  call it: &ldquo;atypical chest pain, chest pain of undetermined origin, unexplained  chest pain, functional chest pain, soldier&rsquo;s heart, irritable heart, sensitive heart,  neurocirculatory asthenia, DaCosta&rsquo;s syndrome, and chest pain with normal  coronary angiograms.&rdquo; </p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/non-cardiac-chest-pain/" class="faqquestion">How will this affect my life?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">Patients with NCCP are more likely to be gainfully  employed and lose an average of 13 days of work/year, which is average for  patients with other functional GI disorders (like irritable bowel) but certainly  higher than those without this disorder.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/non-cardiac-chest-pain/" class="faqquestion">What are the causes of NCCP?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The sources of NCPP can be grouped into esophageal and  non-esophageal. Several studies have shown that approximately 60% or more of  patients with NCCP suffer from acid reflux (mostly due to what is commonly referred  to as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease). Therefore, patients having chest pain who have had a  negative cardiac evaluation are frequently referred to gastroenterologists  (digestive disease specialists) to evaluate the esophagus as source of their  chest pain.</p>
<ol type="I">
<li><strong>Esophageal  Sources of NCCP:</strong></li>
  <ol type="A">
      <li><strong>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) or acid  reflux </strong><br />
  By far the most common cause of  esophageal NCCP is gastroesophageal reflux disease also known as GERD or acid  reflux. Studies estimate that between 22-66% of patients have GERD as a source  of NCCP. In addition to chest pain, patients may complain of heartburn and or  regurgitation or chest pain alone may be due GERD.</li>
      <li><strong>Esophageal contraction  disorders as cause of NCCP: </strong><br />
    Other esophageal causes of chest  pain include disorders of esophagus muscle (esophageal motility disorders) such  as uncoordinated muscle contractions (esophageal spasm), contractions of  extremely high pressure (nutcracker esophagus), and occasionally a disorder  characterized by absence of esophageal muscle contraction due to loss of nerve  cells of the esophagus (achalasia). It is important to recognize particularly  achalasia since is a treatable disorder.</li>
      <li><strong>Visceral  (esophageal) Hypersensitivity:</strong><br />
  Patients with NCCP may also have  &ldquo;visceral hypersensitivity&rdquo; that is an esophagus where the smallest change in  pressure or exposure to acid may result in tremendous pain. This is best  explained by describing an experiment: when a small balloon is placed inside  the (esophagus) and distended, patients with NCCP perceive the distension of  the balloon at very low volumes. This is unlike healthy control subjects who do  not experience this pain at all or may only have pain when the balloon  distension reaches very large volumes. This phenomenon has been termed  &ldquo;Esophageal or visceral hypersensitivity&rdquo; (enhanced esophageal perception or  sensitivity to balloon distension). Although the cause of this increased  sensitivity to balloon distension is unknown, there are treatment modalities  that can be used to improve this exaggerated pain perception.</li>
    </ol>
  <li><strong>Non-esophageal  Causes of NCCP</strong><br />
NCCP is a common disorder with  esophageal causes (described above) and nonesophageal related causes.<br /><br />
Non-esophageal sources that can  cause NCCP include: Musculo-skeletal conditions of the chest wall or spine,  pulmonary (lung) disorders, pleural illness (the layers of tissue that cover  the lungs), pericardial conditions (the layer of tissue that protects the  heart) and even digestive disorders such as ulcers, gallbladder, pancreatic  diseases and rarely tumors (particularly in patients past age 50).</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Role of Stress:</h3>
<p>Some of patients with NCCP have also been found to suffer  from stress that leads to disturbances such as depression, anxiety or panic  disorder. It is unclear whether the stress disorder came first or the chest  pain led to the appearance of an emotional disorder. Treatment of these  conditions is an important component of treating chest pain. </p>

The reasons some studies have found women may have a  higher frequency of NCCP than men is not well understood. </p>
<p>NCCP is a very common problem of international proportions.  Population studies have shown that in the United States as many as 70 million  patients (23% of the population) suffer from NCCP. Similar figures have been described  in Australia (33%), Spain (8-28%), Argentina  (24%), and South China (21%). No other specific  risk factors have been identified.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/non-cardiac-chest-pain/" class="faqquestion">What do I do if Iâve been treated for chest pain, but told I didnât have a heart attack?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Patients suffering from chest pain must have thorough  cardiac evaluations to ensure they do not have heart disease prior to being  labeled as having NCCP. In addition, a variety of other disorders described  above, both esophageal and non-esophageal must also be considered since  specific treatment for these disorders are available.</p>
<p>Once cardiac tests have concluded that patients do not have  heart disease, patients are commonly offered a treatment trial of acid  suppressive inhibition medications (called a PPI - proton pump inhibitor -  trial) for about 2 weeks. This is frequently referred as &ldquo;a PPI trial&rdquo; and can  be both diagnostic and therapeutic since if it relieves the chest pain it  suggests that acid-reflux is likely the cause.Â   Thus, if pain is improved the treatment may be extended for a longer  period of time such as 2 months. If the patient does not improve after &ldquo;a PPI  trial&rdquo;, further testing may be done. Those studies may include a pH study of  the esophagus (a test to actually measure the amount and determine if there is acid  reflux) an upper endoscopy (a scope with a light that is introduced in the  esophagus and stomach to check for other conditions that may cause chest pain),  an esophageal motility test (a test to study the esophagus muscle contractions)  and perhaps an ultrasound of the abdomen to examine the gallbladder for  possible stones.</p>

<li><strong>Patients  may be treated as if the NCCP was a result of having GERD:</strong><br />
  Once cardiac and other  life-threatening conditions have been excluded and, based on the notion that  the most common cause of NCCP is GERD, a treatment trial is frequently considered.<br /><br />
Patients are often prescribed a  proton pump inhibitor (PPI) also called a PPI trial. They must be taken at  least 30-60 minutes before breakfast. It has been shown that this approach  produces an approximately 80% response rate for patients with GERD-related  NCCP.<br /><br />
If the patient responds, the  treatment can be continued for at least 8 weeks at a reduced dose such as Omeprazole  (or equivalent PPI medication ) 20 mg twice daily about 40 min prior to meals. Other  equivalent PPI&rsquo;s can also be employed and include: Esomeprazole, Lansoprazole,  Rabeprazole, and Pantoprazole.</li>
<li><strong>For  patients not responding to a PPI,</strong> <strong>GERD  is the unlikely source of pain: </strong><br />
  For these patients, other medications  are available. These medications are felt to produce their favorable effect by  reducing pain transmission from the esophagus to the brain. The medications  often used are low doses and are from the class of drugs known as tricyclic  antidepressants (TCAs), and not used at the high doses employed for the  treatment of depression.<br /><br />
Commonly used agents are  amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine, imipramine and trazodone. The two  most commonly used agents are imipramine and trazodone. While for the most part  they are safe, side effects may include sleepiness, dry mouth, blurred vision  and urinary retention. Trazodone can also cause a sustained erection (called  priapism), which is considered a medical emergency.<br /><br />
Other categories of antidepressants â such as &ldquo;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&rdquo; or SSRI&rdquo; â can be tried if  TCA are not tolerated because of side effects. Two recent reports suggest that the  SSRI Sertraline may also have a beneficial effect in the treatment of NCCP. This  medicine was found to be more effective than placebo (a sugar pill or an inert  substance) in the treatment of NCCP. New studies are also being done to explore  other SSRI&rsquo;s like paroxetin, fluoxetin and citalopram. Also recent studies have  found potential benefit with the Serotonin and Noradrenalin Reuptake Inhibitor  (SNRI) called Venlafaxine. For patients not responding to either acid  inhibition trial or TCA or other antidepressants, esophageal motility testing  (a study done to evaluate the muscle contractions of the swallowing pipe) may  be done to look for other uncommon causes of chest pain such as achalasia. This  is particularly important since achalasia is a treatable disorder.<br /><br />
A number of studies continue to be  done to better understand the mechanism(s) of pain in NCCP. Furthermore, new  treatment agents are being investigated. A recent study suggested that  receptors in the esophagus, such as the so called adenosine receptors, may  account for visceral pain in NCCP. Using a medication that acts on these  receptors (Theophilline) a group of investigators showed it may be effective  for the treatment of NCCP. However, side effects of this particular agent may  limit its use. Thus, in the future newer medications that act on these  adenosine receptors but that have a better margin of safety may provide new  opportunities for the treatment of this challenging condition.</li>
<li><strong>Management  of stress:</strong><br />
If patients do not respond to the above approach or  they suffer from depression, anxiety, and/or panic disorder, they should be  referred for appropriate psychiatric consultation and treatment. Several recent  studies have also found that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or &ldquo;talk  therapy&rdquo; and relaxation training techniques is effective in improving NCCP when  compared to patients on a waiting list. Other brief preliminary reports have  also found that hypnosis may also help selected patients with NCCP.</li>

What is nausea and vomiting?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Nausea is the unpleasant urge to vomit. Vomiting is the forceful ejection of stomach contents through the mouth. This is generally a protective mechanism to remove harmful ingested substances, but can occur from many unrelated infectious and inflammatory conditions in the body.Â  Muscles in the abdominal wall contract vigorously to create the pressure necessary for vomiting (retching). Retching, also called âdry heavingâ can also occur without vomiting, or can precede or follow vomiting. Similarly, nausea can occur without vomiting or may precede vomiting.</p>
<p>Vomiting must be differentiated from regurgitation, which is the effortless movement of swallowed food contents or stomach acid from the stomach back into the mouth.Â  Regurgitation is not associated with nausea or retching.Â  When regurgitated material tastes sour and bitter, it may be a manifestation of reflux disease, but when it tastes the same as ingested food, it indicates a problem with food movement from the swallowing tube into the stomach.Â  Rumination is another symptom that may resemble vomiting. Rumination consists of regurgitation of ingested food followed by rechewing and reswallowing, and is a learned behavior that may be considered pleasurable by the patient.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/nausea-and-vomiting/" class="faqquestion">How can nausea and vomiting affect you?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Nausea and vomiting are distressing symptoms that can make it difficult to go to work or perform normal activities.Â  Nausea and vomiting after surgery, associated with pregnancy and acute infectious illnesses lead to significant loss of worker productivity and medical expenses.Â  In the United States, it is estimated that the cost of acute stomach infections (often resulting in acute nausea and vomiting) exceeds $1 billion dollars per year in medical expenses alone; the cost of absence from work and lost productivity may be even higher.Â  Some patients feel that nausea and vomiting after surgery is worse than pain after surgery. Nausea and vomiting occurring after a surgical procedure can result in longer hospital stays and higher costs of hospitalization. As many as 8 out of 10 pregnant women develop nausea and vomiting in the early stages of their pregnancy, resulting in time away from work or home. Nausea and vomiting due to cancer chemotherapy can reduce the patientâs ability to complete household tasks, enjoy meals, spend time with others and perform their usual activities.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/nausea-and-vomiting/" class="faqquestion">Common causes of nausea and vomiting</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Common causes of nausea and vomiting include the following:</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
  <li>Medicines. Nausea and vomiting can result from almost any medication. Certain medicines such as chemotherapy for cancer and anesthetic agents are particularly known for causing nausea and vomiting.</li>
  <li>Infections of the gastrointestinal tract. These may be caused by viruses or bacteria and includes gall bladder infections (cholecystitis), appendicitis, viral hepatitis and diverticulitis.</li>
  <li>Infections outside the gastrointestinal tract such as pneumonia, bladder and kidney infections, meningitis and ear infections.</li>
  <li>Bacterial toxins in food (food poisoning)</li>
  <li>Pregnancy</li>
  <li>Motion sickness</li>
  <li>Alcohol intoxication</li>
  <li>Inflammation of the abdominal organs such as pancreatitis, Crohnâs disease or ulcerative colitis.</li>
  <li>Intestinal blockage. This can occur due to stomach or intestinal ulcers, cancers and tumors or inflammatory diseases like Crohnâs disease.</li>
  <li>Slow intestinal movement or transit such as gastroparesis (delayed emptying of stomach), ileus or pseudoobstruction. Slow transit can be due to many causes.</li>
  <li>Migraine headaches</li>
  <li>Other brain and nervous system disorders including tumors of the brain, seizures, head trauma and multiple sclerosis.</li>
  <li>Hormonal disorders including diabetes, overactive thyroid (hyperthyroid) and underactive adrenal glands (Addisonâs disease).</li>
  <li>Kidney failure</li>
  <li>Radiation therapy</li>
  <li>Psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, anorexia nervosa and bulimia.</li>
  <li>Cyclic vomiting syndrome</li>
  <li>Physical or emotional pain</li>
  <li>Heart attack can sometimes manifest as nausea and vomiting</li>
</ol>
<h3>Symptoms of nausea and vomiting</h3>
<p>Nausea is often referred to as a âqueasy sensation" or a feeling of being âsick to the stomach.â Nausea may occur with or without vomiting and vomiting can occur without nausea. These symptoms may be accompanied by a sensation of flushing, sweating, salivation, lightheadedness and upper abdominal discomfort.Â  Important associated symptoms include: anorexia, a decreased interest in eating; sitophobia, a fear of eating due to unpleasant symptoms; and early satiety, feeling full early after eating only a small amount of food.Â  Associated symptoms and circumstances prior to the onset of nausea and vomiting can help your doctor determine the cause.Â  The cause of acute nausea and vomiting can very often be diagnosed by doctors just by listening to the patientâs history and performing a physical examination. Â However, chronic nausea and vomiting, which by definition is when symptoms have lasted longer than 1 month, is more challenging to diagnose and treat.</p>
<h3>Evaluation of nausea and vomiting</h3>
<p>The cause of an acute episode of nausea and vomiting is typically determined through detailed history and physical examination.Â  Only if the cause remains unclear should further diagnostic tests be performed; sometimes tests are performed to determine if there are harmful consequences from nausea and vomiting.Â  If nausea and vomiting are the result of a minor illness or short-term problem, there may be little cause for concern. However, your doctor will determine if hospital admission is need or if further testing can be performed as an outpatient and if medication may be beneficial. Hospital admission is more common for elderly and the very young, as they can become dehydrated quickly. If diarrhea, dehydration, or both are present, intravenous fluids may be needed, necessitating a visit to the doctorâs office, the emergency room or even admission to the hospital. Finally, even if nausea and vomiting are not particularly severe, hospital admission may be needed for tests and further treatment if symptoms do not improve after several days.</p>
<p>A three step approach is recommended for the evaluation of nausea and vomiting.Â  The first step is to evaluate and treat harmful consequences of nausea and vomiting such as dehydration or alteration in chemical levels in the blood (electrolyte imbalance).Â  Next, the cause of nausea and vomiting is investigated and treated.Â  Finally, if no cause can be determined, therapy to improve symptoms is initiated.</p>
<h3>Potential harmful consequences of nausea and vomiting</h3>
<p>Dehydration and/or imbalance of the bodyâs electrolytes and minerals circulating in the blood can be problematic when vomiting is severe or prolonged. This is one of the most important acute consequences of nausea and vomiting.Â  Evaluation consists of measuring vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature), physical examination to look for signs of dehydration, checking levels of chemicals in the blood, evaluating kidney and liver function with blood tests and performing limited tests such as an EKG.Â  Treatment consists of intravenous fluids, sometimes with added chemicals (Ringerâs lactate, fluids with added potassium or magnesium).Â Â <br>
When symptoms are prolonged, weight loss or malnutrition may occur. Supplementation of nutrition to prevent or to reverse weight loss can include feeding into the intestines (enteral nutrition) or sometimes directly into a large vein (parenteral nutrition).Â </p>
<p>Forceful retching or vomiting can lead to tears of the intestinal junction, where the esophagus joins with the stomach. When these tears are limited to the inner lining, they are called Mallory-Weiss tears. Mallory-Weiss tears may cause intestinal bleeding. Passing of bright red or dark blood in the vomitus or from the rectum could be due to Mallory-Weiss tears. Rarely, tears can be through the entire wall of the esophagus resulting in perforation and the escape of stomach contents outside the gut, Boerhaaveâs syndrome. This is a serious condition and can lead to abscess formation or fluid collection, typically around the bottom of the left lung. Violent retching can occasionally cause painful bruises or tears in the abdominal wall muscles.</p>
<h3>Identifying causes of nausea and vomiting</h3>
<p>After a detailed history and thorough physical examination, your doctor will often be able to determine the cause of nausea and vomiting.Â  Knowing what preceded the onset of nausea and vomiting and the following associated symptoms are important clues to uncovering the diagnosis:</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
  <li>Sudden onset of symptoms with fevers, body aches, runny nose, cough and diarrhea may indicate possible infection, usually a virus, but sometimes bacterial infection.</li>
  <li>If symptoms began after anesthesia or following chemotherapy, medication is a likely cause. Similarly, nausea and vomiting may occur after use of recreational drugs (marijuana, cocaine) or alcohol.</li>
  <li>Early morning vomiting often occurs during pregnancy but may also be seen in subjects with kidney failure.</li>
  <li>Vomiting several hours after a meal may suggest blockage in the stomach or intestines.</li>
  <li>Abdominal pain followed by vomiting may suggest inflammation in the abdomen such as pancreatitis or intestinal obstruction.</li>
  <li>Explosive projectile vomiting can be associated with increased pressure inside the brain such as meningitis or tumors.</li>
  <li>Vomiting immediately after a meal could indicate blockage in the stomach but can be associated with psychiatric disorders such as anorexia or bulimia.</li>
  <li>Chronic nausea and vomiting may be caused by hormonal disorders (diabetes, pregnancy) or functional disorders, symptoms in the absence of specific abnormalities that can be identified on testing.</li>
  <li>Cyclic vomiting syndrome is characterized by intense vomiting lasting a few hours or a few days with long periods without symptoms.</li>
  <li>Loss or weight, malnutrition and dehydration may result from long standing nausea and vomiting, as it may be associated with reduced or poor oral intake of nutrients.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the diagnosis still remains unclear after a history and physical, the following tests may be used to provide your doctor with more information:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Blood tests (blood count, measurement of chemical levels in the blood, liver and pancreatic enzymes)</li>
  <li>X rays of the gastrointestinal tract, abdomen, or brain. These can include plain x rays, barium x rays or specialized scans such as CT scans or MRI scans.</li>
  <li>Endoscopy, the use of a long flexible tube with a video camera that allows direct visualization of the swallowing tube, stomach and first part of the small intestine, is performed to look for abnormalities in the lining of these structures that might be causing the nausea and vomiting.</li>
  <li>Tests to assess the movement of food through the stomach and intestines, gastrointestinal motility testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the cause of nausea and vomiting is not clear after a thorough search and if the symptoms are not controlled with standard therapy, psychological tests and evaluation or psychiatric consultation may prove helpful. Psychogenic vomiting and eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia are recognized causes of these symptoms.</p>
<h3>Treatment for nausea and vomiting</h3>
<p>The treatment of nausea and vomiting may depend on the cause. However, the following general measures are appropriate for any patient with significant nausea and vomiting.</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
  <li><strong>Correction of Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance</strong>: Loss of body fluids results in dehydration and alteration in levels of minerals in the blood. Fluid replacement is usually performed with intravenous saline solution containing potassium. Potassium and sometimes magnesium levels may be low in the blood and may need to be added to the intravenous fluid.</li>
  <li><strong>Nutritional Support.</strong>Â Initially, patients should not eat solid food or may need to stop consuming food and drink. When feeding resumes, clear liquids are given first and diet advances as tolerated. When obstruction or chronic symptoms makes feeding by mouth impossible, alternate access for nutrition and fluid support are used. A nasoenteric tube can be placed through the nose into the small intestine and feeding solutions may be administered directly into the intestines (enteral feeding or tube feeding). Â Alternatively, a feeding tube can be directly placed through the abdominal wall into the stomach (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or PEG tube) or intestines (percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy or PEJ tube).Â  Another option is to place a venous catheter into an arm vein or other vein and infuse a prepared solution containing essential nutrients and vitamins directly into the blood stream, total parenteral nutrition or hyperalimentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Therapy for Symptom Relief.</strong>Â Patients with upper abdominal discomfort resulting from fluid in the stomach or intestines (usually in the presence of a blockage) improve if a tube is placed through the nose into the stomach to suction out stomach contents. Medications for nausea and vomiting may be given to prevent symptoms (e.g., before chemotherapy or immediately after surgery) or to suppress symptoms after they have begun. Several types of medications are available and include phenothiazines (such as Compazine and Phenergan), 5-HT3 antagonists (such as Zofran), dopamine receptor antagonists (such as Reglan), antihistamines (Antivert, Dramamine, Benadryl) and anticholinergics (Scopolamine). Other agents that may be used for chronic nausea and vomiting, especially when a cause is not evident in the stomach or intestines, include benzodiazepines (Ativan) and tricyclic antidepressants (Elavil, Pamelor). Medicine to reduce acid production may also be necessary in patients with prolonged vomiting. These agents are administered to protect the esophagus from acidic content of the vomitus.</li>
  <li><strong>Other agents:</strong>Â Several alternative approaches are available for nausea and vomiting. The best-studied alternative therapy is perhaps the use of acupressure for pregnancy related nausea and vomiting. Wristbands with acupressure buttons are commercially available, inexpensive, safe and have been shown to provide relief of mild nausea and vomiting. Ginger and vitamin B6 supplements have also been used successfully as symptom suppressants in pregnancy. Electrical stimulation, usually at the wrist, has also been used to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting with some success. Hypnosis has been used with some success to address the fear of vomiting in patients with psychogenic nausea and vomiting, chemotherapy and pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting. Therapy focuses on hypnotic suggestions for relaxation and symptom reduction as well as distraction through guided imagery.</li>
  <li><strong>Gastric stimulation:</strong>An implanted device with attached electrodes into the gastric wall can be an option for patients with refractory nausea and vomiting.Â  This is utilized in patients with prolonged and persistent nausea and vomiting, usually in the setting of decreased ability of the stomach muscles to push food into the intestines, especially when medical treatment with multiple different medication regimens has failed in controlling symptoms.Â  Gastric stimulation involves a surgical procedure to implant an electronic device into the abdomen, with wires (electrodes) that are attached to the stomach wall.Â  While stomach emptying is typically not improved with this device, nausea and vomiting may improve in about half the patients where this device is implanted.</li>
</ol>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/nausea-and-vomiting/" class="faqquestion">Can nausea and vomiting be prevented or successfully cured?

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Episodic nausea and vomiting with a known cause such as motion sickness, chemotherapy, or surgical anesthesia can be prevented with medicines taken just before the causative event or medication. Symptoms due to medications and toxins improve when the drug or toxin is stopped. Morning sickness of pregnancy will usually resolve as the pregnancy progresses or with delivery. Nausea and vomiting due to chronic disorders such as functional problems, psychiatric disorders, endocrine disorders or cancer may be difficult to treat and may need chronic medications to control the symptoms. If nausea and vomiting are related to an infectious or inflammatory condition, symptoms will generally resolve completely with treatment of the primary condition.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Neonatal jaundice describes a condition in which an infantâs  skin appears yellow within the first few days of life. The yellowish appearance  is a sign of an increased blood pigment called <em><u>Bilirubin</u></em>, which then settles in the skin. In many cases  this is a normal process and occurs in about 2/3 of all healthy newborns. 
  However, it may at times be a sign of a problem with the  babyâs feeding, level of hydration or red blood cells lifespan. Other rare  causes such as metabolism disorders, gland malfunction or liver disease can  also present with jaundice. Only the health care provider can determine if the  infantâs jaundice is normal and may order a blood test to help with diagnosis.  In some cases, a specialist in liver disease or blood disorders may be called  in to help take care of the newborn. Treatment can be very simple from  increasing the babyâs water intake and modifying the feeding to very complex  treatment. The choice of treatment is made according to the severity of the  jaundice, the cause for the increase of bilirubin or the type of bilirubin.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The first symptom is yellow appearance of the skin and the  eyes. The infantâs skin may appear yellow as early as the 1st or 2nd  day of life.Â The jaundice starts around  the head and the face then progresses to the shoulders, arms and the rest of  the body including the legs and feet. The appearance may become more yellow  when the baby is 3 to 4 days old and then slowly gets better. This is called âphysiologicâ  or normal neonatal jaundice. Most infants have this pattern so no testing is  needed. </p>
<p>At times, the yellow appearance may occur earlier (shortly  after birth), last longer than 5-6 days or may be much more pronounced. A  consultation with your health care provider is then needed to determine if  testing is indicated. </p>
<p>Along with the skin becoming more yellow, the color of the babyâs  urine can change from very light yellow or very dark brown. In the same manner,  the color of the babyâs stool can vary from a yellow mustard color (normal) to light  beige. These 2 color changes in the urine or the stool can indicate that the  jaundice is due to different pigments. Although very rare in the first days of  life, the presence of a very dark urine or light beige stool should be  evaluated by a doctor immediately.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The yellow appearance comes from the accumulation of a  yellow pigment called bilirubin in the skin. Right after birth, the infant body  has to break down the red blood cells used while in the womb and make new ones  now that the baby breathes the ambient air. The red color of the blood comes  from a protein called hemoglobin, which carries the oxygen. As cells are being  broken down, the hemoglobin gets modified in the liver and becomes bilirubin.  Because the infantâs liver is so young and immature, it cannot keep up with all  the produced bilirubin, which then leaks into the blood stream and settles in  the skin.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_key><![CDATA[_acg_gi_patients_cpt_basics_sectioncontent_4]]></wp:meta_key>
			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>A variety of conditions or diseases may present with an  increase of the amount of pigment (bilirubin) produced. Poor feeding due to  decreased breast feeding or the amount of breast milk can contribute to the  increase in bilirubin. The same can happen with formula if the infant is not  able to drink a sufficient amount. Maternal diabetes, exposure to some  medications such as sulfa drugs or being underweight can also cause an  increased bilirubin level. </p>
<p>  Other conditions may be more serious:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li><u>Increased       production of bilirubin:</u> In certain diseases, the red blood cells of       the baby are destroyed at a faster rate than normal (this is called hemolysis).       An example of such a disease is when the babyâs and motherâs blood type       are different and not compatible. When this occurs, the motherâs immune       system reacts and will form antibodies that attack the babyâs red blood       cells. Babies also become anemic (low number of red blood cells) due to       rapid destruction (hemolysis). </li>
  <li><u>Birth       trauma:</u> When vacuum extractors or forceps are used to deliver the baby       a very large bruise over the scalp or the head may occur. This very large       bruise will be re-absorbed. The old blood from the bruise will break down       to make more bilirubin, which needs to be cleared by the liver. Some also       may leak into the blood stream.</li>
  <li><u>Infection:</u> Babies with infections may not be able to process bilirubin normally       resulting in increased levels in the blood. This can occur with infection       in the urine, blood, liver or other organs.</li>
  <li><u>Problems       with bilirubin metabolism</u>: In very rare cases the babyâs liver is not       able to change the bilirubin into a form that can easily be removed from       the body. This occurs in a condition called Crigler-Najjar syndrome. This       is a very rare disease; the level of bilirubin increases very rapidly       within hours. Immediate attention by a newborn specialist is then needed.</li>
  <li><u>Problems       with digesting galactose</u>: Rarely, babies cannot normally break down       the sugar in breast milk (lactose) or in regular formulas made using the       protein from cowâs milk. The sugar of the milk (lactose) is broken down       into 2 smaller sugars called glucose and galactose. Rarely, the babyâs       liver cannot process galactose. This is called galactosemia. This disease       can present with jaundice in the newborn period and is associated with       other severe symptoms (such as lethargy, vomiting, irritability and       possibly convulsions). Galactosemia is often detected by a blood test       (heel prick) before discharge from the nursery as part of the mandatory       state screening for newborn diseases. Galactosemia is treated with strict       dietary avoidance of galactose. This is <u>not</u> the same as being       lactose intolerant and the two conditions should not be confused. </li>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>If the doctor is concerned about the severity of the jaundice,  a blood test called a serum <u>total bilirubin</u> level is performed using a  very small amount of blood. Other tests such as a transcutaneous (through the  skin) test may be used to determine the bilirubin level in certain hospitals.  This test is less accurate and needs to be confirmed with blood testing.</p>
<p>If the result is high, your doctor will order a blood test  that will measure the different types of Bilirubin pigments, which make up the  total bilirubin: </p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li><em><u>Unconjugated or indirect bilirubin</u></em>:       This pigment is increased mostly in infants with neonatal jaundice. It is       the bilirubin associated with normal destruction of older red blood cells.       This is called physiologic jaundice. The babyâs urine is usually light       yellow and the stool color is mustard yellow or darker. <strong></strong><br><br />
  In some cases, the level of indirect  bilirubin can go very high. Then, a neonatal specialist or blood specialist may  be called in to help care for the newborn. Doctors are concerned if the  bilirubin levels are more than 20-25 mg/dl (deciliter) and will start treatment  to prevent the bilirubin from getting to this level. A level of indirect bilirubin  at or above 20-25 mg/dl may cause irritation in some areas of the brain. This  is called acute encephalopathy (inflammation of the brain). If the bilirubin  remains very high, above 25 mg/dl, babies can be at risk for significant brain  damage. This very rare condition is called kernicterus.Â Because of that risk, the doctor will start  testing early for the bilirubin level and repeat the test often to identify the  trend and start treatment rapidly. </li>
  <li><em><u>Conjugated or Direct bilirubin</u></em>:       The previous pigment (indirect or unconjugated bilirubin) is packaged in       the liver into a form ready for removal into the bile and the gallbladder.       This pigment is called conjugated (packaged) or direct bilirubin. For a       variety of reasons, the liver cannot get rid of it, the direct bilirubin       leaks back into the blood and also settles in the skin. At times the urine of the baby can be       dark âcoca colaâ color and the stool can be light beige.<br /><br />
  The symptoms can be very different  from those of normal neonatal jaundice. Babies can be very irritable, fussy,  may have fever or they can have no symptoms. In addition to blood work to look  for infections, other testing may be performed. A specialist in liver disease  in children, called a pediatric gastroenterologist, may be called in consultation  to help sort out the diagnosis. Liver disease is diagnosed with additional  blood tests; the specialist may order an ultrasound or other specialized testing.  These may lead to a procedure called a liver biopsy, where a small sample of  liver tissue is taken for examination under a microscope. Â </li>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The treatment varies based on the cause of the jaundice and  the bilirubin level. For the purpose of this information we will discuss only  the treatment for the elevation of the <em><u>unconjugated or indirect bilirubin</u></em> pigment.Â We will not discuss the  jaundice associated with liver disease or the rare diseases causing an  elevation of the pigment called <em><u>conjugated or direct bilirubin</u></em>.</p>
<p>Usually in normal physiologic neonatal jaundice, the process  will be self-limiting and the baby does not need to be treated. The  unconjugated bilirubin is broken down just with some exposure to the indirect sunlight.  This is by far the vast majority. The baby  may be able to be discharged home from the nursery within 48 hours of life  without problems. The baby will need to be followed up by the pediatrician to  ensure that the bilirubin level is going down and the babyâs weight is  appropriate. This is especially true with breast-fed babies.</p>
<p>If the <em><u>unconjugated or indirect bilirubin</u></em> level remains high or is increasing, the baby may  need further treatment to decrease the bilirubin level. Treatments might  include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Some  babies have a high indirect bilirubin level associated with breast feeding.  Holding breast feeding and supplementing with infant formula for 48 hours may  in some cases decrease the bilirubin in babies with âbreast feeding jaundice.â  A small amount of breast fed babies may continue to have elevated indirect  bilirubin after 10-14 days. Once again holding breast feeding for 2 or 3 days may  be sufficient and breast feeding can resume when the level of indirect  bilirubin is lower. Breast feeding is by far the best option for neonates and  should not be stopped completely because of a mild elevation of the <em><u>unconjugated or indirect bilirubin</u></em>. Families should speak with their physician or health care provider to determine  if stopping breast feeding is appropriate and for instructions on how to  proceed.</li>
  <li>Phototherapy is a treatment that allows the bilirubin  under the skin to be broken down by a special light that illuminates the babyâs  body. These lights are usually blue-green. They are placed about 4 inches above  the baby. The more skin that is exposed to the lights, the better they work to  break down a larger amount of <em><u>unconjugated or indirect bilirubin</u></em>. The lights do not prevent the baby from drinking  formula or being breast-fed. The baby can be safely removed from the  phototherapy at feeding times without decreasing the efficacy of the treatment.  There are generally no significant risks with phototherapy. The eyes of the  baby will have shields to prevent the light from harming the babyâs eyes and  retina. There are no risks to the genitals of the baby. As long as the level of  bilirubin is not very high, the phototherapy treatment can be done at home with  a special blanket called a âbiliâ blanket. The physicians will then arrange for  blood tests to be done regularly to ensure that the treatment is working. Most insurance  will pay for this treatment at home.</li>
  <li>For  a few babies, the level of <em><u>unconjugated or indirect bilirubin</u></em> is so high (greater than 20-25 mg/dl) that  physicians are concerned about brain damage. The level has to be brought down  very fast using a technique called exchange transfusion. An exchange  transfusion is performed in the neonatal intensive care unit. The babyâs blood  is exchanged and replaced very slowly and carefully with a donorâs blood. This  allows for the indirect bilirubin to be removed faster, which will decrease the  risk of further complications. This treatment is reserved for the most serious  cases at risk for developing kernicterus (a condition where the indirect  bilirubin is stored in areas of the brain and causes abnormal movements and  seizures.)</li>

What is gallstone pancreatitis?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Gallstone pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas that results from blockage of the pancreas duct by a gallstone. This occurs at the level of the sphincter of Oddi, a round muscle located at the opening of the bile duct into the small intestine. If a stone from the gallbladder should travel down the common bile duct and get stuck at the sphincter, it blocks outflow of all material from the liver and pancreas. This results in inflammation of the pancreas that can be quite severe. Gallstone pancreatitis can be a life-threatening disease and evaluation by a physician urgently is needed if someone with gallstones suddenly develops severe abdominal pain.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">How is gallstone pancreatitis diagnosed?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Blood tests can identify inflammation of the pancreas (amylase and lipase) and evidence of obstructed outflow of bile from the liver (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin). Inflammation of the pancreas is best demonstrated by an abdominal CAT scan, which can also determine the severity of the pancreatic inflammation. CT scans are not as sensitive at identifying small gallstones and an abdominal ultrasound may be ordered if this is considered the cause of the pancreatitis</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/gallstone-pancreatitis/" class="faqquestion">What is the treatment of gallstone pancreatitis?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Pancreatitis is best treated initially by avoiding any intake of liquids and solids until the inflammation subsides. Intravenous delivery of fluids is usually all thatâs required if the inflammation is modest and symptoms resolve in a few days. Severe inflammation, persistent pain or fevers suggest severe pancreatitis and ongoing inflammation. Intravenous delivery of nutrients would be started if oral intake cannot be restarted within approximately 5-7 days. Severe nausea and vomiting are treated initially by relieving the stomach of fluid by use of a nasogastric tube and with antinausea medications. </p>
  Pain therapies may be administered by intravenous until oral treatments and food intake can resume. Sometimes it is important to remove a gallstone causing pancreatitis urgently, and other times it may be appropriate to wait 24-48 hours with regular assessments to assure the individual remains stable. Stones that cause gallstone pancreatitis may pass out of the duct without intervention or may require endoscopic or surgical removal. In cases of infected pancreatic tissue, or a condition called pancreatic necrosis (dead tissue) occurs, antibiotics may be used to control or prevent infection.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/intestinal-ischemia/" class="faqquestion">What is Intestinal Ischemia?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Intestinal ischemia is the term used to describe the result  of a variety of disorders that cause insufficient blood flow to the  gastrointestinal tract. Such ischemic injuries can manifest with symptoms  ranging from a mild bout of short-lived abdominal pain or diarrhea to bloody  diarrhea or a more serious situation, such as gangrene that may require surgery  and even end in death. </p>
<p>Intestinal ischemia can be a devastating disease, but there  has been extraordinary progress over the past 50 years in our medical  understanding of intestinal ischemia; a growing number of physicians now  recognize and diagnose intestinal ischemia early, thereby improving outcomes  for their patients. Current management of intestinal ischemia has evolved from  simply managing the grave consequences after an acute event to more aggressive  and proactive methods aimed toward recognizing and exploring early warning  signs and preventing potentially catastrophic complications. With our current knowledge of the disease and the  availability of modern diagnostic and therapeutic options, it is now possible  to offer increasing comfort and reassurance that the intestines and the lives  of many patients can be salvaged.</p>
<p>It is  essential to emphasize that successful management of intestinal ischemia  involves a partnership between patients and their physicians. Recognition of  the early symptoms and risk factors for the disease by patients greatly enhances  their physiciansâ ability to offer a diagnosis and appropriate management.  </p>
</div>
</li>



<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/intestinal-ischemia/" class="faqquestion">What are the types of Intestinal Ischemia? </a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>In general terms, ischemia either can be localized to a  relatively small part of the small intestine or colon, or it may be more  widespread and involve significant portions of both.</p>
<p>The time course of the ischemic event also may vary and be  acute (new), chronic (long-standing), or recurrent. </p>
<p>An ischemic problem may be caused by an interruption in  blood passage through an artery (a blood vessel that brings blood to the  intestines) or vein (a blood vessel that returns blood from the intestines to  the heart). There are several ways in which arterial blood supply to the  intestines can be restricted: an embolus (a migrating blood clot that can form  a blockage), a thrombus (a stationary clot attached to the wall of a blood  vessel that can prohibit blood passage), or a so-called non-occlusive state  (spasm of a blood vessel, but without permanent obstruction, that restricts  blood flow through an artery). </p>
<p>Venous problems also may result in intestinal ischemia,  although less commonly than arterial causes. The most common cause of ischemia  from venous obstruction is a thrombus which interferes with the return of blood  flow from the intestines, produces intestinal congestion, and results in  intestinal swelling, and occasionally bleeding. </p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/intestinal-ischemia/" class="faqquestion">What are the possible consequences of Intestinal Ischemia?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The ultimate effects of reduction in intestinal blood flow  vary. The milder forms of ischemic injury may involve several days of abdominal  discomfort and altered bowel habits (e.g., diarrhea, bloody stool) or chronic  low-grade cramping abdominal pain associated with eating (âintestinal anginaâ).  The more severe cases may present with life-threatening gangrene and rupture of  the intestines or bleeding, and may require hospitalization and surgery. In  order to take full advantage of the advances made in the diagnosis and treatment  of these disorders and to improve the chances of recovery, early diagnosis is  essential. Individuals who experience the symptoms detailed below, particularly  those persons who are identified at greatest risk for intestinal ischemia,  should seek the attention of their physician immediately. </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/intestinal-ischemia/" class="faqquestion">What are the signs and symptoms of Intestinal Ischemia?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Intestinal ischemia exhibits a broad spectrum of  presentations. There is no single set of symptoms which can fully predict the  type of ischemic injury, its cause or its prognosis. There are, however, some  generally recognized patterns of ischemic disease.</p>
<p>The most common form of ischemic injury to the intestines is  colon ischemia. Colon ischemia usually manifests as sudden, mild-to-moderate  left-sided lower abdominal pain with an urgent desire to defecate, and the  passage, within 24 hours, of bright red or maroon blood mixed with the stool. Alternatively,  some patients with colon ischemia manifest severe right-sided lower abdominal  pain with minimal to no bleeding. The vast majority of patients with colon  ischemia do well; a minority develops irreversible disease such as chronic  ischemic colitis, stricture (narrowing) formation or gangrene. Patients who  have colon ischemia that is confined to the right side of the colon have a  worse prognosis with a greater need for surgery and a higher mortality rate than  patients whose colon ischemia affects other parts of the colon, alone or in  combination with right-sided involvement. </p>
<p>Most patients with an acute episode of small intestinal  ischemia present with the sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. Early in the  process, the abdomen is usually soft, flat, and not tender to touch. Most  patients with small intestinal ischemia do not have diarrhea or rectal  bleeding. Abdominal distention may be the first sign of a serious injury to the  intestines. A sudden, forceful bowel movement associated with severe abdominal  pain suggests an acute arterial occlusion caused by an embolus. </p>
<p>A more slowly developing course usually occurs when small  intestinal ischemia is caused by an arterial obstruction from a thrombus. The  obstruction is usually clinically silent but causes pain when blood flow is  insufficient to permit the basic activities of the intestines, such as normal  motility and digestion. The presence of abdominal pain specifically after meals  in the weeks to months before an acute thrombosis is sometimes prelude to such  an occurrence.</p>
<p>Patients with acute small intestinal ischemia resulting from  a thrombus in a vein rather than an artery also experience abdominal pain. The  pain is more variable and typically less severe than with arterial thrombosis;  it may occur in a so-called âtumbleweedâ type of recurring and remitting  abdominal pain. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea with  or without blood. Here again, patients usually have already had more subtle  symptoms prior to the sudden event. Many patients with a venous thrombus have  been diagnosed with blood clots in the past or have a high risk of developing  clots because of a familial clotting problem, or underlying conditions like cancer,  inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or lupus, or because they take medications  that may promote clotting such as oral contraceptives. </p>
<p>The presence of non-occlusive acute small intestinal  ischemia (from spasm of the blood vessels) may be overshadowed by the other  illnesses a patient might have, such as heart failure, hypotension (low blood  pressure), a heart attack, or cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heart beat). A  patient in these settings may already be quite ill and abdominal pain may be  absent. Unexplained abdominal distention or bleeding from the rectum may be the  only signs of intestinal ischemia in these circumstances. </p>
<p>Chronic small intestinal ischemia (or âintestinal anginaâ)  is typically associated with dull, cramping abdominal pain felt 10 to 30  minutes after eating and reaching its peak 1 to 3 hours after a meal. The pain  can increase in severity to where the patient fears eating and therefore  reduces the size of meals or eats less frequently and loses weight. Symptoms of  this condition, in contrast to those of the other intestinal ischemic  disorders, usually become progressively more severe over an extended period of  time, without resulting in a severe crisis until late in the picture. </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/intestinal-ischemia/" class="faqquestion">Why does Intestinal Ischemia occur?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The gastrointestinal tract forms a complex system of tubing  that extends more than 30 feet from the mouth to the anus. The intestines  perform a variety of essential tasks, most important of which is the absorption  of nutrients from food and the concentration and passage of waste from the body  in the form of stool. These activities require oxygen and other vital  substances that are delivered to and recycled from the intestines by an  extensive and often redundant network of blood vessels called arteries and  veins. </p>
<p>When intestinal blood flow is diminished to a point that  there is a shortage of the resources the intestines require for their  sustenance, intestinal ischemia results; this shortage prevents the intestines  from functioning properly. The type and prognosis of ischemic injury can vary  greatly and depends on the cause of the injury, the blood vessel(s) involved,  the underlying medical condition of the patient, and the swiftness with which  the problem is brought to medical attention for diagnosis and treatment. </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/intestinal-ischemia/" class="faqquestion">Who is at risk for Intestinal Ischemia?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Identification of intestinal ischemia often involves a high  level of suspicion.</p>
<p>Generally, those who are most susceptible are individuals older  than 50 years of age, particularly those who suffer from diseases such as heart  failure and irregularities of cardiac rhythm, and those who have had a heart  attack or stroke. Various medications used to treat migraine headaches and  constrict blood vessels or oral contraceptives also may lead to intestinal  ischemia. Additionally, individuals predisposed to developing blood clots, also  called a venous thrombosis, are more likely to develop intestinal ischemia.  This problem can affect young people as well as older individuals and is most  often seen in those who have suffered a recent traumatic leg injury and  individuals who have been immobile for long periods of time. Others at  increased risk for blood clots are those who have a predisposing genetic  disorder, IBD, or cancer. </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/intestinal-ischemia/" class="faqquestion">How is Intestinal Ischemia diagnosed and treated? </a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The diagnosis and treatment of intestinal ischemia varies  somewhat depending on the particular patient, suspected source, and clinical  situation. What is consistent and clear, however, is that early diagnosis is  essential to improve the chances for a good outcome. In general, the longer the  injury is sustained without treatment, the greater the chance that the damage  done to the intestines will be irreversible. </p>
<p>The first considerations for a physician in diagnosing  intestinal ischemia are the patientâs past medical history, his or her current  symptoms, and results of a thorough physical examination. The diagnostic tools  most commonly used to supplement this information include routine blood tests,  colonoscopy, ultrasound, abdominal radiologic studies including CAT or MRI scans,  mesenteric angiography, and exploratory abdominal surgery. Angiography is a  special radiologic study of oneâs blood vessels. Contrast material is injected  through a small catheter placed into an abdominal artery or vein, after which radiologic  images of the vessels are generated. </p>
<p>In acute small intestinal ischemia, particularly cases  caused by arterial blockage, initial management of the patient includes  addressing the relevant underlying and precipitating medical conditions,  intravenous or âIVâ fluids, and antibiotics to prevent possible infection.  Angiography is considered the gold standard for diagnosis and is usually  performed after a CT scan has shown that the abdominal pain is not caused by  any other disorder that is mimicking intestinal ischemia. Sometimes a  CT-angiogram, which is a non-invasive way of studying the intestine and its  blood vessels, obviates the need for a formal angiographic study. Afterwards, a  treatment decision is made based largely upon the findings on angiography and  the physicianâs assessment of the patientâs clinical status. If a significant  embolus or thrombus is found in a blood vessel and the patient appears ill, a  laparotomy (open abdominal surgery) or laparoscopy (exploration of the abdomen  through an endoscopic tube inserted into the abdominal cavity) generally is  recommended either to remove the obstruction in the blood vessel or to create a  bypass route for blood around the blockage. If, at the time of surgery, the  surgeon finds segments of the intestine that are necrotic, that portion of  bowel is resected (removed), and the portions of the intestine above it and  below are reconnected. A second operation may be performed within 24 hours to  see if the now treated blood vessels have allowed previously injured portions  of the intestine to recover. If so, there may be no need for further resection.  Medication that dilates, or widens vessels in order to improve blood flow can  be given via the arterial catheter put in place during angiography, usually  prior to, but occasionally after, surgery. </p>
<p>When a venous obstruction is suspected, CT scan has been  used successfully for diagnosis. Angiography can be used more selectively to  aid in treatment of a particular vein. When patients are demonstrated to have a  thrombus in a vein and are not considered to have signs of infarction,  anticoagulant (âblood thinningâ) drugs, and/or medication aimed toward  dissolving the clot can be used. If a patient develops signs of more  threatening ischemia, surgery is indicated to remove clots and any  unsalvageable segments of the intestines, as discussed above. </p>
<p>In cases of non-occlusive intestinal ischemia, there is no  identifiable point of blockage seen by angiography. Rather, the blockage is  caused by diffuse spasm in the blood vessels supplying the intestines and the  spasm is precipitated by underlying medical conditions such as heart failure,  cardiac arrhythmias, and hypotension; these underlying conditions must be  addressed to help restore blood delivery to the intestines. Patients with vasospasm  may benefit from by administration of a vasodilator through a catheter directly  placed in the main blood vessel supplying the intestine to break the spasm and  thereby improve intestinal blood flow. </p>
<p>In colon ischemia, the extent and severity of the injury  again dictates the action taken. If the patient is stable, colonoscopy is  ideally performed within 24-48 hours of the onset of symptoms. Patients in this  situation can expect to be placed on a restricted diet in the short-term, and  given antibiotics to prevent serious infection. In most cases, symptoms abate  within 1 to 2 days and the injury to the colon resolves in 1 to 2 weeks. A  minority of patients develop more significant consequences and are treated  accordingly, possibly with surgery. </p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/intestinal-ischemia/" class="faqquestion">What are the risks and benefits of therapy for Intestinal Ischemia? </a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The complications of angiography and medication infusion by  catheter have included transient, reversible kidney problems, and bruising at  sites of catheter insertion. With more significant surgical procedures there  are, of course, additional risks. However, the alternative of delayed diagnosis  in treatment of intestinal ischemia, particularly in cases of acute small  intestinal ischemia, offers far more devastating consequences. Such delay,  particularly of waiting until intestinal infarction develops, carries a  mortality rate of 70%-90%. At medical centers that routinely treat patients  with intestinal ischemia more than 50% of the patient can survive with an  aggressive approach, using early diagnosis and prompt therapy with vasodilators  and surgery; more than 75% of patients treated in this way have lost no more  than a small fraction of their intestines. The importance of early diagnosis is  demonstrated by the fact that 90% of patients who were ultimately diagnosed  with acute small intestinal ischemia, but who had not developed late signs of  ischemic damage such as peritonitis (inflammation of the tissue lining the  inside of the abdomen), survived this injury. In other words, people who sought  out their physicians and who had their disease diagnosed at an early stage of  intestinal ischemia had a much better outcome than those in whom diagnosis was  made late. </p>

    <li>To prevent excessive belching, avoid:
      <ul>
        <li>Carbonated beverages</li>
        <li>Chewing gum</li>
        <li>Hard candiesÂ <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Simethicone may be helpful</li>
    <li>Abdominal bloating and discomfort may be due to intestinal sensitivity or symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. To relieve symptoms, avoid:
      <ul>
        <li>Broccoli</li>
        <li>Baked beans</li>
        <li>Cabbage</li>
        <li>Carbonated drinks</li>
        <li>Cauliflower</li>
        <li>Chewing gum</li>
        <li>Hard candy</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Abdominal distention resulting from weak abdominal muscles:
      <ul>
        <li>Is better in the morning</li>
        <li>Gets worse as the day progresses</li>
        <li>Is relieved by lying down</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To prevent Abdominal distention:
      <ul>
        <li>Tighten abdominal muscles by pulling in your stomach several times during the day</li>
        <li>Do sit-up exercises if possible</li>
        <li>Wear an abdominal support garment if exercise is too difficult</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Flatulence is gas created through bacterial action in the bowel and passed rectally. Keep in mind that:
      <ul>
        <li>10-18 passages per day are normal</li>
        <li>Primary gases are harmless and odorless</li>
        <li>Noticeable smells are trace gases related to food intake</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Foods that are likely to form gas include:
      <ul>
        <li>Milk, dairy products, and medications that contain lactose--<em>If your body doesn't produce the enzyme (lactase) to break it down.</em></li>
        <li>Certain vegetables--baked beans, cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage</li>
        <li>Certain starches--wheat, oats, corn, potatoes. Rice is a good substitute.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If flatulence is a concern, see your doctor to determine if you are lactose intolerant.</li>
    <li>Identify offending foods. Reduce or eliminate these gas-forming foods from your diet.</li>
    <li>Activated Charcoal may provide some benefit.</li>

    <li>Ulcers are "sores" that frequently affect the stomach and the first part of the small intestine (duodenum).</li>
    <li>Bacterial infection is the most common cause of duodenal ulcers.</li>
    <li>Stomach ulcers are often a side effect of pain killers and anti-inflammatory drugs used primarily to treat arthritis.</li>
    <li>Alcohol ingestion, cigarette smoking, and emotional stress may also influence the development of an ulcer or interfere with its healing.</li>
    <li>Upper abdominal pain is the most common symptom of ulcers, but many ulcers cause no symptoms at all.</li>
    <li>Ulcers may hemorrhage (bleeding) into the gastrointestinal tract; this results in the passage of black ("tarry") stool. Very serious ulcer disease may also cause a blockage between the stomach and small intestine and this complication results in persistent vomiting. Severe pain results from the most urgent complication of ulcers - peritonitis caused by a tear through the wall of the stomach or duodenum.</li>
    <li>Almost all ulcers can be treated successfully, usually without surgery. Many ulcers can be prevented.</li>
    <li>Ulcer treatments include antibiotics, agents that neutralize gastric acid or reduce its secretion, and drugs that strengthen the resistance of the stomach and duodenum.</li>

    <li>Abnormal swallowing is commonly perceived as food "sticking on the way down." If this complaint persists, it is sometimes due to a serious condition and should always prompt medical attention.</li>
    <li>Swallowing difficulty may be caused by a number of different problems including:
      <ul>
        <li>Poor or incomplete chewing (possibly the result of dental problems, poorly fitted dentures, or eating too quickly)</li>
        <li>Abnormal muscle contraction</li>
        <li>Scar tissue from chronic inflammation</li>
        <li>Infection</li>
        <li>Cancer</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Heartburn is a very common problem caused by regurgitation or reflux of gastric acid into the esophagus, which connects the mouth and the stomach.</li>
    <li>Heartburn can often be eliminated by avoiding:
      <ul>
        <li>Smoking</li>
        <li>Fatty food in the diet</li>
        <li>Caffeine</li>
        <li>Chocolate</li>
        <li>Peppermint</li>
        <li>Overeating</li>
        <li>Bed-time snacks</li>
        <li>Tight-fitting clothes that constrict the abdomen</li>
        <li>Certain medications</li>
        <li>Heavy lifting, straining</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>It is important to consider the possibility of heart disease before attributing any kind of chest pain to gastroesophageal reflux.</li>

    <li>Nutrition plays a role in cardiovascular disease, some malignancies, adult-onset diabetes, osteoporosis, alcoholism, and recovery from major injury.</li>
    <li>Malnutrition can weaken the immune system, impair healing following surgery or injury, lessen mobility, and reduce mental capabilities and function. It is common in older adults.</li>
    <li>To maintain good health, total fat intake should be reduced to 30% or less of calories. Saturated fat intake should only account for 10% (one third of fat calories). Salt and alcohol intake also should be limited.</li>
    <li>Dietary fat content composed primarily of monounsaturated fat (eg, olive oil) and polyunsaturated fat (eg, canola, corn and fish oils) may be associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease.</li>
    <li>Foods to be avoided include whole milk and dairy products (ice cream, cheese, butter); commercially baked goods (cookies and crackers); hot dogs, ham, and cold cuts; and oils, gravies, and salad dressing.</li>

    <li>Gallstones typically develop over many years, although they can form in months. Gallstones are present in about 20% of women and 10% of men over the age of 55.</li>
    <li>There are two basic types of gallstones: cholesterol and pigment. Cholesterol gallstones are the most common type in the United States.</li>
    <li>About 75% of gallstones do not cause symptoms. The most common symptom caused by gallbladder stones is episodic upper abdominal pain.</li>
    <li>For healthy patients who have no symptoms, no therapy or change in diet is needed. Patients with uncomplicated symptomatic gallbladder stones should reduce dietary fat and consider surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy). An alternate approach is oral bile acid therapy. For complicated disease, gallbladder removal is warranted.</li>
    <li>Patients who undergo rapid weight loss are at risk for the development of small cholesterol gallstones and may benefit from bile acid therapy. Gallstones can seldom be prevented, although a low-fat diet may provide some protective benefit.</li>

    <li>Five different hepatitis viruses have been identified: type A; type B; type C; type D, or delta virus; and type E. Type A is probably the most prevalent type of viral hepatitis worldwide, followed by types B, E, C, and D.</li>
    <li>Hepatitis A and E are transmitted through fecally contaminated food or water. Other modes of transmission include needle sharing among intravenous drug abusers; sexual contact; maternal transmission; and transmission by blood transfusion.</li>
    <li>A simple blood test is used to determine that a person has one or more of the different types of hepatitis.</li>
    <li>Acute hepatitis is typically characterized by flu-like symptoms (including fever, headaches, fatigue, nausea and vomiting) and jaundice. Chronic hepatitis is often asymptomatic.</li>
    <li>Vaccines are available to protect against hepatitis A and B. Additionally, immune globulin for hepatitis A or hepatitis B is recommended when someone has been exposed to an infected person.</li>
    <li>Among the ways to care for your liver are: limiting alcohol consumption; avoiding liver- damaging drugs; practicing safe sex; avoiding use of illegal drugs; avoiding high doses of vitamins unless prescribed; avoiding tattoos and the sharing of razors; not eating raw shellfish from questionable sources; and carefully following directions for use of toxic substances (e.g., cleaning products).</li>

    <li>The small intestine and the colon have a relatively restricted blood supply and are frequently affected by circulatory disorders, whereas the esophagus, stomach, and rectum are well supplied with blood and are only occasionally involved in circulatory disturbances.</li>
    <li>The colon is commonly affected by ischemia (reduction of blood flow to a level not permitting normal function). In most cases, symptoms subside within days and healing is seen within 2 weeks. Antibiotics and bowel rest usually suffice. In complicated disease, damaged parts of the colon must be removed surgically.</li>
    <li>Acute mesenteric ischemia results from inadequate circulation of blood to the small intestine. Treatment is aimed at dilating (opening) the blood vessels with drugs and/or surgery to restore intestinal blood flow and to remove any irreversibly damaged bowel.</li>
    <li>Chronic mesenteric ischemia results when blood flow to the small intestine is reduced to an insufficient level. It causes pain associated with eating. Surgery is often warranted to correct the problem.</li>

    <li>Use of medications increases with age: 80% of older Americans who live independently receive 20 or more prescriptions per year Residents of nursing homes receive an average of 8-10 drugs per day</li>
    <li>It is important to take medications as prescribed. Reasons for not following directions include:
      <ul>
        <li>Too many drugs</li>
        <li>Error due to visual or mental impairment</li>

    <li>See your doctor regularly to check on medications and their effect (bring your medications with you for an office visit or to an emergency room): Drug effect changes with aging There is decreased absorption of drugs through the intestinal tract Decreased kidney function slows drug elimination Metabolism of drugs changes with age</li>
    <li>The effect medications have on your body will change with aging. For example: Drug action may last longer Drugs may produce toxicity at a lower dose in mature adults than in younger adults</li>
    <li>Remember that all changes you experience are not necessarily due to aging. For example, decrease in salivary flow is: Due to disease or medication not due to aging</li>

        <li>FeverÂ <br>
          See your doctor if you have any of these symptoms</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>There are two types of IBD:
      <ul>
        <li>Ulcerative Colitis
          <ul>
            <li>Starts in rectum and spreas upward</li>
            <li>Affects men more tham women</li>

        <li>Too small</li>
        <li>Too hard</li>
        <li>Too difficult to pass</li>
        <li>Infrequent (less than 3 per week)</li>

        <li>Not enough dietary fiber or fluids</li>
        <li>Medication side effects</li>
        <li>Emotional or physical stress</li>

        <li>Respond to urges to move your bowels</li>
        <li>Avoid straining</li>
      </ul>
      See your doctor if these measures don't work</li>
    <li>Dietary therapy (increased fiber and fluids) and fiber supplements are the preferred treatment for chronic constipation.</li>
    <li>In some cases, your doctor may recommend the use of stool softeners.</li>
    <li>Use of mineral oil or stimulant laxatives regularly, consult your doctor to make sure what you are using is right for you.</li>
    <li>Incontinence of stool or fecal soiling is most often due to leakage around a fecal impaction. Removing the impaction will usually restore continence.</li>
    <li>Incontinence of stool in healthy older people deserves full education and treatment. Treatment options include:
      <ul>
        <li>Adjustment in dietary fiber to reduce amount of stool</li>
        <li>Medications to decrease stool frequency</li>
        <li>Prescribed use of enemas (not soap enemas)</li>
        <li>Biofeedback training</li>
        <li>Surgery to restore anal function</li>

    <li>Keep in mind that a high-fiber diet may tend to improve:
      <ul>
        <li>Chronic constipation</li>
        <li>Coronary heart disease</li>
        <li>Hemorrhoids</li>
        <li>Diabetes mellitus</li>
        <li>Diverticular disease</li>
        <li>Elevated cholesterol</li>
        <li>Irritable bowel syndrome</li>
        <li>Colorectal cancer</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Try to double your daily fiber intake.
      <ul>
        <li>Average American intake: 10-15 grams per day</li>
        <li>Recommended intake: 20-35 grams per day</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Understand what fiber is, where it comes from:
      <ul>
        <li><em>Insoluble fiber</em>
          <ul>
            <li>Cereals</li>
            <li>Wheat/wheat bran</li>
            <li>Whole grains</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><em>Soluble fiber</em>
          <ul>
            <li>Brans</li>
            <li>Fruit</li>
            <li>Oatmeal/oat bran</li>
            <li>Psyllium</li>
            <li>Vegetables</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Substitute high-fiber foods for high-fat and low-fiber foods.</li>
    <li>Keep your daily fiber intake stable. Consider a fiber supplement if you:
      <ul>
        <li>Travel</li>
        <li>Eat away from home often</li>
        <li>Find it difficult to get enough fiber through food choices alone</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Don't shock your system: Increase fiber levels in your diet gradually.</li>
    <li>Always increase fluids (water, soup, broth, juices) when you increase fiber.</li>
    <li>Add both soluble and insoluble fiber, from a variety of sources.</li>
    <li>Compare fiber content of foods:

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer-screening/" class="faqquestion">What is colorectal cancer?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Colorectal (large bowel) cancer is a  disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the inner lining of the colon  or rectum. Together, the colon and rectum make up the large bowel or large  intestine. The large intestine is the last segment of the digestive system (the  esophagus, stomach, and small intestine are the first three sections). The  large bowel's main job is to reabsorb water from the contents of the intestine  so that solid waste can be expelled into the toilet. The first several feet of  the large intestine is the colon and the last 6 inches is the rectum. </p>
<p>Most colon and rectal cancers originate  from benign wart-like growths on the inner lining of the colon or rectum called  polyps or flat lesions. The difference between polyps and flat lesions is  primarily just their shape, with polyps growing more into the lumen than flat  lesions. Not all polyps and flat lesions have the potential to transform into  cancer. Those that do have the potential are called adenomas and sessile  serrated polyps (also called sessile serrated adenomas). It takes more than 10  years in most cases for a precancerous polyp or flat lesion to develop into  cancer. This is why some colon cancer prevention tests are effective even if  done at 10-year intervals. This 10-year interval is too long, in some cases,  such as in persons with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis, in persons with  a strong family history of colorectal cancer or adenomas, in persons who  themselves have previously had colorectal cancer, and some persons who have had  precancerous polyps or flat lesions</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer-screening/" class="faqquestion">How common is colorectal cancer? </a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Colorectal  cancer is the second most common cancer killer overall and third most common  cause of cancer-related death in the United States in both males and  females. Lung and prostate cancers are more common in men and lung and breast  in women. In 2012, there will be 143,000 new cases and 52,000 deaths from  colorectal cancer. About 6% of persons who reach the age of 50 in the United  States will develop colorectal cancer without screening.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer-screening/" class="faqquestion">Who is at risk for colorectal cancer?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<ul type="disc">
  <li><em>Everyone age 50 and older.</em><br />
    The average age to develop colorectal cancer is 70 years, and 93% of cases       occur in persons 50 years of age or older. Current recommendations are to       begin screening at age 50 if there are no risk factors other than age for       colorectal cancers. A person whose only risk factor is their age is said       to be at average risk. </li>
  <li><em>Men and women</em><br />
    Men tend to get colorectal cancer at an earlier age than women, but women       live longer so they 'catch up' with men and thus the total number of cases       in men and women is equal. </li>
  <li><em>Anyone with a family history of       colorectal cancer.</em><br />
    If a person has a history of two or more first-degree relatives (parent,       sibling, or child) with colorectal cancer, or any first-degree relatives       diagnosed under age 60, the overall colorectal cancer risk is three to six       times higher than that of the general population. For those with one       first-degree relative diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age 60 or older,       there is an approximate two times greater risk of colon cancer than that       observed in the general population. Special screening programs are used       for those with a family history of colorectal cancer. A well-documented       family history of adenomas is also an important risk factor. </li>
  <li><em>Anyone with a personal history of       colorectal cancer or adenomas at any age, or cancer of endometrium       (uterus) or ovary diagnosed before age 50.</em><br />
    Persons who have had colorectal cancer or adenomas removed are at       increased risk of developing additional adenomas or cancers. Women       diagnosed with uterine or ovarian cancer before age 50 are at increased       risk of colorectal cancer. These groups should be checked by colonoscopy       at regular intervals, usually every 3 to 5 years. Woman with a personal       history of breast cancer have only a very slight increase in risk of       colorectal cancer. </li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer-screening/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of colorectal cancer?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Symptoms of  colorectal cancer vary depending on the location of the cancer within the colon  or rectum, though there may be no symptoms at all. The prognosisis worse on  average in symptomatic as compared to asymptomatic individuals (the latter  refers to persons with cancer discovered by screening). The most common  presenting symptom of colorectal cancer is rectal bleeding. Cancers arising  from the left side of the colon generally cause bleeding, or in their late  stages may cause constipation, abdominal pain, and obstructive symptoms. On the  other hand, right-sided colon cancers may produce vague abdominal aching, but  are unlikely to present with obstruction or altered bowel habit. Other symptoms  such as weakness, weight loss, or anemia resulting from chronic blood loss may  accompany cancer of the right side of the colon. You should promptly see your  doctor when you experience any of these symptoms. </p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer-screening/" class="faqquestion">Why should you get checked for colorectal cancer even if you have no symptoms?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Precancerous  polyps and flat lesions can grow for years and transform into cancer without  producing any symptoms. By the time symptoms develop, it is often too late to  cure the cancer, because it may have spread. Screening identifies cancers earlier  and actually results in <u>cancer prevention</u> when it leads to removal of  pre-cancerous growths</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer-screening/" class="faqquestion">What is screening for colorectal cancer?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Screening means  looking for cancer or polyps when patients have no symptoms. Finding colorectal  cancer before symptoms develop dramatically improves the chance of survival.  Identifying and removing polyps before they become cancerous actually prevents  the development of colorectal cancer.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer-screening/" class="faqquestion">What tests are available for screening?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Several options  are available for screening average-risk persons. </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><em>Colonoscopy</em><br />
    Your doctor can examine your entire colon and rectum during colonoscopy.       The procedure is used to look for early signs of cancer in the colon and       rectum where they could not be reached by sigmoidoscopy. Polyps and flat       lesions can be removed during colonoscopy. Sedation is usually used for       colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is currently the only test recommended for       colorectal cancer screening in average-risk persons at 10 year intervals</li>
  <li><em>Flexible Sigmoidoscopy</em><br />
    An examination in which a doctor uses a sigmoidoscope (a thin, lighted       instrument) to view the inside of the lower colon and rectum (usually       about the lower 2 feet) for polyps and cancers. If a precancerous growth       is found, colonoscopy should be performed. Sigmoidoscopy does not examine       the entire colon and so is less reliable than colonscopy for detecting       polyps and flat lesions. Sedation is usually not used for sigmoidoscopy.       Sigmoidoscopy is performed every 5 years, often in conjunction with an       annual fecal occult blood test. </li>
  <li><em>Fecal occult blood test</em><br />
    One of the presentations of colon cancer is chronic blood loss in the       stool. Sometimes, such blood loss is so minimal, it cannot be seen when       the stool is inspected in the toilet. Your doctor will ask you to collect       a stool sample which is returned to the doctor or lab to test for occult       (hidden) blood. There are two types       of tests, called the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and the guaiac test.       The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is the better test. Either test is done annually. If either test is       positive, colonoscopy should be done</li>
  <li><em>Computerized topographic (CT)       colonography and magnetic resonance (MR) colonography</em><br />
    These tests are sometimes called "Virtual Colonoscopy". These       two tests are fairly new methods that allow your doctor to look for       colorectal polyps and cancers. Virtual Colonoscopy uses a CT scanner (CT       colonography) or Magnetic Resonance scanner (MR colonography) along with       computer-assisted software to look inside the body without having to       insert a long colonoscope into the colon or without having to fill the       colon with liquid barium. These two tests are performed by radiologists. The       US Preventive Services Task Force and the Centers for Medicare and       Medicaid Services do not endorse CT colonography or MR colonography for       screening, so they may not be covered by your insurance program.  </li>
  <li><em>Double contrast barium enema (DCBE)</em><br />
    Barium is a white liquid that helps to show the inside image of the colon       and rectum on an X-ray. The liquid barium is put into the colon using a       rectal tube. Multiple X-rays are taken to look for polyps or cancers. DCBE       is less expensive than colonoscopy but also less effective. DCBE has not       been established as a reliable colorectal cancer screening test in any       rigorous scientific studies. One scientific report, the National Polyp       Study, found that DCBE detected only 50% of the larger adenomas (greater       than 1 cm), and DCBE is inferior to colonoscopy for detection of       colorectal polyps. Because of its limitations, DCBE is not widely used for       colorectal cancer screening. If used for screening, it should be done       every 5 years. If polyps are found, colonoscopy should be performed.       Another X-ray test, single contrast barium enema (SCBE) is generally       considered inferior to DCBE for detecting polyps and, thus, SCBE is not       recommended for colorectal cancer screening.</li>
  <li><em>Fecal </em><em>DNA testing</em></br>
Colorectal cancers contain abnormal  DNA which is shed into the stool. In this a sample of stool is checked for  abnormal DNA and colonoscopy is performed if any is found. This test should be  repeated at 3 years if itâs negative.</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer-screening/" class="faqquestion">What else can I do to prevent the development of colorectal cancer?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p><p>The strategy for reducing colorectal       cancer deaths is simple. </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>For normal risk individuals, screening       tests begin at age 50 and the preferred approach is a screening       colonoscopy every 10 years; an alternate strategy consists of annual stool       test for blood and a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years. </li>
  <li>Colonoscopic surveillance (also called       screening colonoscopy) needs to be available at more frequent intervals       for individuals at high risk for colon cancer (for instance, those with a       personal history of colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps; family       history of colorectal cancer; Hereditary Non-polyposis Ccolorectal Cancer;       or a pre-disposing condition such as inflammatory bowel disease. (Medicare       provides for surveillance colonoscopy no more frequently than once every       two years for those at high risk.) </li>
  <li>For both average and high risk       individuals, all potential pre-cancerous polyps should be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recent  observations suggest regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin,  reduce the chances of colorectal cancer death by 30-50%. These drugs also have  risks, particularly intestinal bleeding, and patients should consult their  physician as to whether regular use of these agents is appropriate. Folate, calcium,  and post-menopausal estrogens each have a modest protective benefit against  colon cancer. A normal blood level of Vitamin D is associated with lower risk  of colorectal cancer. A diet high in fiber and fruits and vegetables and low in  fat diet, regular exercise, maintenance of normal body weight and cessation of  smoking are also beneficial. None of the measures is as effective as or should  replace colorectal cancer screening. </p>

What is indigestion?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Indigestion, also known as dyspepsia, is a term used to describe one or more symptoms including a feeling of fullness during a meal, uncomfortable fullness after a meal, and burning or pain in the upper abdomen. Indigestion is common in adults and can occur once in a while or as often as every day. </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/dyspepsia/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of indigestion?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Most people with indigestion experience more than one of the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fullness during a meal.</strong> The person feels overly full soon after the meal starts and cannot finish the meal.</li>
<li><strong>Bothersome fullness after a meal.</strong> The person feels overly full after a mealâit may feel like the food is staying in the stomach too long.</li>
<li><strong>Epigastric pain.</strong> The epigastric area is between the lower end of the chest bone and the navel. The person may experience epigastric pain ranging from mild to severe.</li>
<li><strong>Epigastric burning.</strong> The person feels an unpleasant sensation of heat in the epigastric area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other, less frequent symptoms that may occur with indigestion are nausea and bloatingâan unpleasant tightness in the stomach. Nausea and bloating could be due to causes other than indigestion.</p>
<p>Sometimes the term indigestion is used to describe the symptom of heartburn, but these are two different conditions. Heartburn is a painful, burning feeling in the chest that radiates toward the neck or back. Heartburn is caused by stomach acid rising into the esophagus and may be a symptom of GERD. A person can have symptoms of both indigestion and heartburn.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/dyspepsia/" class="faqquestion">
How is indigestion diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer"><p>To diagnose indigestion, the doctor asks about the person's current symptoms and medical history and performs a physical examination. The doctor may order x rays of the stomach and small intestine.</p>
<p>The doctor may perform blood, breath, or stool tests if the type of bacteria that causes peptic ulcer disease is suspected as the cause of indigestion.</p>
<p>The doctor may perform an upper endoscopy. After giving a sedative to help the person become drowsy, the doctor passes an endoscopeâa long, thin tube that has a light and small camera on the endâthrough the mouth and gently guides it down the esophagus into the stomach. The doctor can look at the esophagus and stomach with the endoscope to check for any abnormalities. The doctor may perform biopsiesâremoving small pieces of tissue for examination with a microscopeâto look for possible damage from GERD or an infection.</p>
<p>Because indigestion can be a sign of a more serious condition, people should see a doctor right away if they experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>frequent vomiting</li>
<li>blood in vomit</li>
<li>weight loss or loss of appetite</li>
<li>black tarry stools</li>
<li>difficult or painful swallowing</li>
<li>abdominal pain in a nonepigastric area</li>
<li>indigestion accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, or pain that radiates to the jaw, neck, or arm</li>
<li>symptoms that persist for more than 2 weeks</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/dyspepsia/" class="faqquestion">How is indigestion treated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer"><p>Some people may experience relief from symptoms of indigestion by:</p>
<ul>
<li>eating several small, low-fat meals throughout the day at a slow pace</li>
<li>refraining from smoking</li>
<li>abstaining from consuming coffee, carbonated beverages, and alcohol</li>
<li>stopping use of medications that may irritate the stomach liningâsuch as aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs</li>
<li>getting enough rest</li>
<li>finding ways to decrease emotional and physical stress, such as relaxation therapy or yoga</li>
</ul>
<p>The doctor may recommend over-the-counter antacids or medications that reduce acid production or help the stomach move food more quickly into the small intestine. Many of these medications can be purchased without a prescription. Nonprescription medications should only be used at the dose and for the length of time recommended on the label unless advised differently by a doctor. Informing the doctor when starting a new medication is important.</p>
<p><strong>Antacids</strong>, such as Alka-Seltzer, Maalox, Mylanta, Rolaids, and Riopan, are usually the first drugs recommended to relieve symptoms of indigestion. Many brands on the market use different combinations of three basic saltsâmagnesium, calcium, and aluminumâwith hydroxide or bicarbonate ions to neutralize the acid in the stomach. Antacids, however, can have side effects. Magnesium salt can lead to diarrhea, and aluminum salt may cause constipation. Aluminum and magnesium salts are often combined in a single product to balance these effects.</p>
<p>Calcium carbonate antacids, such as Tums, Titralac, and Alka-2, can also be a supplemental source of calcium, though they may cause constipation.</p>
<p><strong>H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs)</strong> include ranitidine (Zantac), cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), and nizatidine (Axid) and are available both by prescription and over-the-counter. H2RAs treat symptoms of indigestion by reducing stomach acid. They work longer than but not as quickly as antacids. Side effects of H2RAs may include headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and unusual bleeding or bruising.</p>
<p><strong>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)</strong> include omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), lansoprazole (Prevacid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex), and esomeprazole (Nexium) and are available by prescription. Prilosec is also available in over-the-counter strength. PPIs, which are stronger than H2RAs, also treat indigestion symptoms by reducing stomach acid. PPIs are most effective in treating symptoms of indigestion in people who also have GERD. Side effects of PPIs may include back pain, aching, cough, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, gas, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea.</p>
<p><strong>Prokinetics</strong> such as metoclopramide (Reglan) may be helpful for people who have a problem with the stomach emptying too slowly. Metoclopramide also improves muscle action in the digestive tract. Prokinetics have frequent side effects that limit their usefulness, including fatigue, sleepiness, depression, anxiety, and involuntary muscle spasms or movements.</p>
<p>If testing shows the type of bacteria that causes peptic ulcer disease, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat the condition.</p></div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/enteral-and-parenteral-nutrition/" class="faqquestion">
What do Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition Refer To?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Enteral nutrition generally refers to any method of feeding that uses the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to deliver part or all of a person's caloric requirements. It can include a normal oral diet, the use of liquid supplements or delivery of part or all of the daily requirements by use of a tube (tube feeding). The site of entry of the tube and tube types will be discussed under "enteral access". Parenteral nutrition refers to the delivery of calories and nutrients into a vein. This could be as simple as carbohydrate calories delivered as simple sugar in an intravenous solution or all of the required nutrients could be delivered including carbohydrate, protein, fat, electrolytes (for example sodium and potassium), vitamins and trace elements (for example copper and zinc). There are many reasons for enteral and parenteral nutrition including GI disorders such as bowel obstruction, short bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis; as well as certain cancers or in comatose patients. While enteral nutrition is always preferred when technically possible, some people may have a variety of medical issues that make the safe use of the GI tract difficult. Alternatively, their calorie and nutrient needs may not be met by the current level of functioning of their GI tract. That is when parenteral nutrition may be needed to help an individual remain hydrated and possibly to provide calories and other nutrients to allow for growth and development or maintenance of physical well-being and function.</p></div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/enteral-and-parenteral-nutrition/" class="faqquestion">When Would a Patient Really Require Enteral Nutrition?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>When a patient has difficulty eating for whatever reason, and if the GI tract is working, then using this natural means for feeding would be preferable to feeding by intravenous means. Using the GI tract is closer to normal and can help the immune system. An example might be a patient who has had a stroke and now has difficulty swallowing (called dysphagia). The swallowing may normalize over time or in some instances may not return to normal which could put the patient at risk for inadvertently swallowing any solids and liquids consumed into the lungs which could cause a severe pneumonia. During the short term, a patient like this might be fed with a tube entering the nose. For longer use, a tube entering the stomach from outside the abdomen (a gastrostomy) might be appropriate.</p></div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/enteral-and-parenteral-nutrition/" class="faqquestion">What is Meant by and What are Examples of Enteral Access?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Tube feeding is nutrition provided through the GI tract via a tube, catheter, or a surgically made hole into the GI tract. As previously mentioned, it is the preferred method of feeding when patients are unable to eat enough calories on their own. Enteral access devices are feeding tubes placed directly into the GI tract to deliver nutrients as well as additional fluids and often is a method for delivering medications (Figure 1). Nasal or oral tubes may be placed at the bedside or with endoscopy. A nasoenteric tube means that the tube enters the nose and the end of it may be in the stomach, duodenum (first part of the small intestine) or the jejunum (second part of the small intestine). Gastrostomy and jejunostomy tubes are inserted through the skin (percutaneous) through a small incision on the upper abdominal wall. This may be done by a Radiologist with X-ray guidance, by an Endoscopist via endoscopy, or surgically. The table below shows options for enteral access feeding (Table 1). Short-term enteral nutrition is usually defined as use less than 4 weeks; long-term enteral nutrition is defined as use for more than 4 weeks. For more specific information on percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, please see the ACG patient resource of the same name.

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/enteral-and-parenteral-nutrition/" class="faqquestion">What are the Complications of Enteral Nutrition?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Nutrition delivered by enteral tubes can cause the following complications: food entering the lungs, constipation, diarrhea, improper absorption of nutrients, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, high blood sugar, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and decreased liver proteins. Feeding tubes inserted through the nose, such as nasogastric or nasoenteric tubes, can cause irritation of the nose or throat, acute sinus infections, and ulceration of the larynx or esophagus. Feeding tubes inserted through the skin of the abdominal wall, such as gastrostomy or jejunostomy tubes, can become clogged (occluded) or displaced, and wound infections can occur.</p></div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/enteral-and-parenteral-nutrition/" class="faqquestion">Can Enteral Nutrition be Done at Home?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Enteral nutrition may be done at home. Orders that specify protocols for administration and monitoring will be written by a provider or dietitian. Most protocols require the prescriber to indicate the formula for feeding, strength, how quickly to feed, and delivery method. Delivery methods include the following: gravity controlled and pump assisted. Gravity controlled feeding refers to any feeding method that uses manually controlled devices to deliver a feeding which is almost always a gastric feeding. This may include a continuous gravity feeding that is manually controlled with a feeding bag and a roller clamp to help control the rate; and intermittent gravity feeding where 200-300 mL are delivered over 30-60 minutes every 4-6 hours; and, a bolus feeding where a specific volume of feeding is infusing via bag or a syringe rapidly over several minutes, usually at a rate of about 60 mL/minute. Pump assisted feeding utilizes an electric pump device to more precisely control the rate of delivery in patients who are at a higher risk of inadvertently getting formula in their lungs, sensitive to volume, have delayed gastric emptying or are being fed into the small intestine. Choice of the delivery methods for a particular person depends on the type of enteral access device as well as the person's individual needs. Water flushes should be administered to prevent clogging and ensure adequate hydration. Feeding tubes should be flushed with water before and after medication delivery and before and after every feeding or every 4 hours during continuous feeding. Often a dietitian, nurse or home care company will teach the patient how to prepare, administer, and monitor tube feeds. In addition, a home care company may be available to explain the supply options available and help to arrange for home supplies and equipment.</p></div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/enteral-and-parenteral-nutrition/" class="faqquestion">Who May Benefit from Parenteral Nutrition?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Anyone who cannot/will not eat, or cannot maintain their fluid and/or nutritional status by oral eating or by tube feeding may be appropriate for intravenous nutrition. Again, the preferred route is by using someone's GI tract, but this is not always possible. The intravenous route is more complicated and expensive to do and is almost always started in the hospital.</p></div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/enteral-and-parenteral-nutrition/" class="faqquestion">What Are the Options for Delivering Parenteral Nutrition?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Parenteral nutrition access options include central venous catheters which may include short term catheters which are tubes that are put in place in the hospital and generally removed prior to discharge and long term options (such as tunneled Hickman catheters) located in the upper chest, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) located in the upper arm, and ports implanted under the skin usually in the upper chest wall. (See figures 2 and 3 below). Many catheters are available in multilumen versions to allow for simultaneous infusion of multiple fluids and/or medications. Central venous catheters are commonly used for patients requiring weeks, months or years of therapy. A Hickman catheter is a brand of catheter that is tunneled under the skin and put in place either in a Radiology Department or in an operating room. A Hickman catheter requires dressing care to be performed by the patient, a family member or a Home Care Service. A PICC is commonly used in patients who require therapy for a short duration, usually for several weeks to a few months. A PICC may be placed while in the hospital at the patient's bedside, in the Radiology Department or rarely at home by a specially trained registered nurse. Depending on the local protocol, a PICC also may require routine flushing with a drug called heparin to prevent clogging and additional site care and also has a higher rate of the catheter moving out of position than a Hickman catheter. Ports are often used for patients requiring months to years of therapy and are commonly used where intermittent infusion therapy is needed such as cancer chemotherapy. Care of a port is needed only when the port is accessed. This is done by cleaning the skin before placing the special needle into the port and monitoring of the port site closely. Ports allow for people to maintain their body image, and there are no external components that may be prone to damage when the port is not in use. Placement of a port usually occurs in an operating room or by a Radiologist with X-ray guidance.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/enteral-and-parenteral-nutrition/" class="faqquestion">What Are the Complications of Parenteral Nutrition, and How Can They be Prevented or Decreased?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>The most common complications associated with catheter placement include infection, clogging (occlusion), and breakage. A strict infection control protocol is recommended regardless of the type of catheter placed and includes the following: hand washing, aseptic site and hub care (wearing gloves, prepping site with topical antiseptics, etc.), port sterilization before access, close monitoring of catheter site appearance for redness or inflammation. Catheter occlusion, or inability to infuse a solution and/or aspirate a blood sample, may be prevented by flushing the catheter to keep it open. Catheter occlusion may arise from blood, IV fat solutions, or precipitates (abnormal crystal formation in a solution) and may be treated with a declotting agent administered by a Registered Nurse. When a catheter is cracked, leaking, or broken, the catheter must be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. A catheter is clamped between the exit site and the break to prevent entrance of air or leakage of blood.</p>

<p>Thrombosis (blood clot) of a blood vessel around an intravenous catheter is another potential complication with intravenous therapy as well as intravenous nutrition. Many factors play a part in the clotting of a vessel and different institutions may have special protocols for both prevention and treatment.</p></div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/enteral-and-parenteral-nutrition/" class="faqquestion">Can Parenteral Nutrition be Done at Home?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) requires a team of clinicians to successfully manage and minimize the associated complications as discussed above. Home parenteral nutrition may be performed for many conditions as a short-term therapy or as a long-term therapy. As the parenteral nutrition formula is being adjusted in preparation for discharge from the hospital, the patient and caregiver will receive education on catheter care, operation of the infusion pump, parenteral nutrition set-up and disconnect procedures, maintenance of intake and output records, review of metabolic complications, and contact numbers for associated problems that may arise. All patients are monitored closely for electrolyte disturbances with routine blood draws to assure stability on HPN formula and clinic visits. If a patient needs readmission to the hospital, the nutrition support team and home nutritional support clinician will often work with the hospital team to provide continuity of care.</p></div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/enteral-and-parenteral-nutrition/" class="faqquestion">Can I Work While on Parenteral Nutrition?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>There are many individuals who continue to work and have very full and productive lives while receiving parenteral nutrition. The main determinant will be the degree of disease that caused the underlying GI problem that is left, as well as symptoms the patient is experiencing. Each person needs to be assessed individually as to their wishes and overall medical condition to determine if they are well enough to work.</p></div>

What is ERCP?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or ERCP, is an endoscopic technique that is used to examine and treat problems in the bile and pancreatic ducts, and the gallbladder. The bile ducts are channels, analogous to plumbing, that drain bile from the liver and gallbladder; the pancreatic ducts drain the pancreas. Both types of ducts empty into the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ercp-a-patients-guide/" class="faqquestion">Why is ERCP Performed?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>ERCP may be performed for a variety of reasons. The most common reason is to find and remove gallstones lodged within the bile duct. However, other  reasons can include finding causes of persistent pain in the upper abdomen on the right side, looking for causes of acute pancreatitis (acute inflammation of the pancreas) and to relieve obstruction of the bile duct caused by tumors such as  pancreas cancer. Often, in many of these situations, an ultrasound of the abdomen or a special kind of MRI study called MRCP may be performed to obtain preliminary information that can guide the need for ERCP.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ercp-a-patients-guide/" class="faqquestion">How is ERCP Performed</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>ERCP is performed by gastroenterologists or surgeons who are specially trained in this technique. An endoscope is a long, flexible tube with a camera and a light at the tip. First, you will be adequately sedated to the point of appearing asleep (often referred to as âconscious sedationâ or âmoderate sedationâ). Usually this is achieved with intravenous medications, but sometimes general anesthesia is necessary. The endoscope or tube is placed into the mouth and advanced into the esophagus, stomach, and to the point in the duodenum where the bile duct enters; this is known as the papilla. A plastic catheter (thin tube) is threaded through the scope to come out its tip and then is maneuvered to enter the papilla and the ducts. Contrast dye (radio-opaque material) is then injected into the ducts and x-rays are taken. By examining the ducts in this way, information about blockages, stones, tumors, or irregularities of the ducts can be gathered. If abnormalities are found, the doctor can perform techniques to repair or improve the condition. For example, if stones are seen, the papilla can be widened or cut open and stones may be removed from the duct. The papilla contains a sphincter muscle that is often cut using cautery (the passage of electric current) during the procedure (sphincterotomy), which allows for better duct drainage.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ercp-a-patients-guide/" class="faqquestion">How do I Prepare for ERCP?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>You will be required to fast prior to your procedure. The stomach should be empty in order for the stomach to be fully visualized. An empty stomach also decreases the risk of vomiting and aspiration.</p>

<p>You should discuss all current medications with your doctor, as some may need to be adjusted or temporarily stopped prior to the procedure. This step is especially important if you are taking aspirin, blood thinners (warfarin or heparin), clopidogrel, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), insulin, or other medicines for diabetes.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are common medications used to treat arthritis, pain or inflammation, and include ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac, to name a few. Blood thinning medicines and aspirin or clopidogrel may need to be discontinued several days prior to your procedure. It is also important to discuss any medication allergies, including those to iodine or intravenous (IV) contrast dye.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ercp-a-patients-guide/" class="faqquestion">It is important to tell your doctor if you have obstructive sleep apnea or other lung conditions?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>If you wear CPAP at night, you should discuss with your doctor whether you should bring your machine with you on the day of your procedure.</a>

<p>If you have any heart conditions, you should also discuss these with your doctor, as special testing prior to your procedure may be needed.</p>

<p>You will need a family member or friend to accompany you on the day of your procedure in order to transport you home after you have received sedative medications.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ercp-a-patients-guide/" class="faqquestion">What Should I Expect in the Endoscopy Suite?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>Upon arriving at the endoscopy unit, you will answer questions about your medical history and your medications will be reviewed. The ERCP procedure will be thoroughly explained and you will be given a chance to ask any questions that you might have. An intravenous (IV) line will be placed in order to provide IV fluids, sedating medications, and possibly antibiotics. Depending on the unit and the situation, you may either undergo conscious sedation (moderate sedation), or general anesthesia. General anesthesia is administered by an anesthesia specialist and may require a breathing tube since it is a deeper level of sedation. You will be asked to remove any dentures or eyeglasses prior to being sedated.</p>

<p>You will be brought to the ERCP room and will be positioned on a special table that allows for x-rays to be taken. You will be asked to lie on your left side, stomach, or back. A small plastic mouthpiece will be placed in your mouth to help protect your teeth and gums. Once sedation is administered, you should expect to be comfortable and asleep or very relaxed. The procedure is generally well-tolerated and most people feel fine afterwards.</p>

<p>Depending on what is seen during the ERCP, a variety of techniques may be performed, including taking biopsies, widening the sphincter (sphincterotomy), removing stones, placing a stent (tube) across any narrowed areas, or other treatments. The length of the procedure varies from 30 minutes to over an hour.  Air is introduced through the endoscope so that the endoscopist can see the inside of your stomach and intestine during the examination.</p>

<p>Once the procedure is finished, you will be brought to the recovery room and monitored while the sedative medications wear off. Sometimes patients feel mild abdominal discomfort from the air in the intestines. This is usually relieved by belching or passing gas. A sore throat is a fairly common complaint. It is treated with throat lozenges and typically resolves in one to two days. You may feel groggy or have difficulty concentrating, so patients are advised to rest for the remainder of the day. You will not be permitted to drive your car for the rest of the day. Depending upon how your initial recovery goes, you may be admitted to the hospital overnight for observation.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ercp-a-patients-guide/" class="faqquestion">What are the Possible Complications of ERCP?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>While ERCP is generally a safe and well-tolerated procedure, several risks are associated with it. Your physician should discuss the potential risks with you prior to your procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bleeding</strong> may occur, particularly if the papilla sphincter is cut. The bleeding is usually minimal and resolves on its own. If it occurs during the procedure, it can be treated with a variety of endoscopic techniques, including placement of hemoclips, injection of epinephrine (which constricts blood vessels), or use of cautery.</li>
<li><strong>Infection</strong> of the bile ducts (cholangitis) can occur, especially if the bile ducts are not draining well. Antibiotics during the procedure and for a few days following ERCP are indicated in certain patients.</li>
<li><strong>Pancreatitis</strong> (inflammation of the pancreas) occurs in 3% to 7% of all patients who undergo ERCP. This would be felt as more severe abdominal pain that does not get better by belching or passing gas. While most post-ERCP pancreatitis is mild, rarely, it can be severe and life-threatening, requiring hospitalization.</li>
<li><strong>Perforation</strong> (a tear or hole) of the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, or ducts may occur. While this is a rare complication that may heal on its own, it may be severe, and may even require surgery for repair.</li>
<li><strong>Aspiration</strong> may occur when food from the stomach refluxes into the back of the throat and is inhaled, causing difficulty breathing or pneumonia. This risk is minimized in patients who have fasted for several hours prior to the procedure.</li>
<li><strong>Adverse</strong> reaction to sedative medicines or anesthesia.</li>
</ul>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/ercp-a-patients-guide/" class="faqquestion">When Should I Call My Doctor?</a>

<div class="faqanswer"><p>You should contact your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms after your ERCP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fever or chills</li>
<li>Severe abdominal pain</li>
<li>Vomiting</li>
<li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
<li>A crunching sensation underneath the skin</li>
<li>Severe abdominal bloating with firmness and tenderness</li>
<li>Bleeding (red, maroon or black stool, or vomiting blood)</li>
</ul>
<p>If biopsies were taken during your test, you should follow-up as instructed by your physician to discuss the results.</p>
</div>

Food Choice as a Key Management Strategy for Functional Gut Symptoms</strong></h3>

<p>Professor Peter Gibson reviews the quality of the evidence on diets high or low in poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates, known as FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligo-, Di- and Mono-saccharides and Polyols) and their impact on functional gastrointestinal symptoms. In a discussion with Co-Editor Dr. Bill Chey, Professor Gibson provides insights on implementing dietary approaches in the office and discusses the challenges of recognizing patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Diarrhea is a frequent side effect of antibiotics, occurring 10â20% of the time. It usually gets better when the antibiotics are stopped. <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection (CDI) is due to a toxin-producing bacteria that causes a more severe form of antibiotic associated diarrhea. The disease ranges from mild diarrhea to severe colon inflammation that can even be fatal. CDI usually occurs when people have taken antibiotics that change the normal colon bacteria allowing the <em>C. difficile</em> bacteria to grow and produce its toxins. Since 2000, there has been a dramatic increase in the number and severity of cases of <em>C. difficile</em> infection (CDI) in the US, Canada and other countries. <em>C. difficile</em> is a gram positive bacterium.  This bacterium is everywhere in the environment, and produces spores that are hard to get rid of. <em>C difficile</em> produces two main toxins - toxins A and B - that cause inflammation in the colon. </p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The major risk factor for CDI is taking antibiotics in the previous several weeks, but sometimes it occurs even without prior antibiotic use. High-risk antibiotics are clindamycin, cephalosporins, and quinolones (i.e. ciprofloxaxin, levofloxacin). Major risk factors are older age, weakened immune system, having other illnesses, and being in a hospital or a long-term care facility. However, even healthy individuals who have not had antibiotics can develop CDI. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohnâs disease or ulcerative colitis) are more likely to get CDI, and may be sicker than patients with IBD alone or CDI alone. Many studies have also suggested that use of acid suppressive medications (proton pump inhibitors) may increase the risk of CDI. Individuals can pick up <em>C. difficile</em> by ingesting spores that are all around in the environment, especially in hospitals. Infected individuals excrete spores, and transmission among patients in hospital has been well documented.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p><em>C. difficile</em> infection requires documenting the presence of toxin in the stools, usually by testing for the gene that produces toxin B, using a method called PCR. It is very sensitive, so it should not be used to test solid stools since that is likely a carrier state. An older test is an enzyme immunoassay test for toxin A and B, but it is less sensitive.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>First, it would be ideal to stop the antibiotic that led to the infection in the first place. This may not always be possible, however, as some infections, like severe bone or heart infections, need long-term antibiotics.  If the symptoms are mild, metronidazole 500 mg, three times a day for ten days is recommended. If one cannot tolerate metronidazoleâs side effects, or early in pregnancy when it is not recommended, alternate treatment is vancomycin 125 mg, four times a day for ten days. If the patient does not get better after several days on metronidazole, a switch to vancomycin is recommended. Fidaxomicin is a new antibiotic that appears equivalent to vancomycin, but is much more expensive. Antidiarrheal drugs should never be used for CDI, as slowing down an inflamed colon may result in a severe complication called toxic megacolon.</p>
<p>Patients with severe disease may not have diarrhea if their colon is very inflamed. They are usually very sick, with fever, severe abdominal pain and tenderness. In such cases, oral vancomycin is the best choice. Sometimes intravenous metronidazole is added as well. In some patients, CDI is so severe that antibiotics do not work. When this happens, surgery to remove the colon may be needed to save the personâs life.</p>
<p>While antibiotics are effective in treating most cases of CDI, the symptoms recur after the end of treatment in 10-20% of cases. This is called recurrent CDI and usually occurs 1â2 weeks after stopping treatment. After a recurrence, the chance of further recurrences goes up to 40-60%, perhaps because one is using an antibiotic to treat a disease caused by antibiotics. We presume that the normal colonic bacteria have not had a chance to recolonize. A common treatment is to give vancomycin in a pulsed regimen â taking it one day but then skipping a day, and increasing the number of days between doses. Perhaps this allows the normal bacteria to return on the âoff antibioticâ days. The most effective treatment, however, is fecal microbiota transplant, also known as stool transplant. In studies, it has been effective in over 90% of patients who received the treatment, and has been proven effective with several randomized controlled trials.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/constipation-in-children/" class="faqquestion">What is constipation?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Constipation  can be defined as condition in which the bowel movements occur less frequently  than usual or stools tend to be hard, painful and difficult to pass.Â Any definition of constipation depends upon  the usual pattern and consistency of a childâs stools.Â It can affect up to 10% of children at any  given time.</p>
</div></li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/constipation-in-children/" class="faqquestion">What is considered a normal bowel pattern?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p><u>Infants </u><br />
The first bowel movement usually occurs within 36  hours after birth in term babies (babies born within two weeks of their  expected due date). Regular or normal bowel movements can vary significantly  among children, especially among infants. Breast fed infants usually have more  frequent bowel movements than formula fed babies. Bowel movements tend to  become firmer and less frequent in infants following the introduction of  âsolidâ (i.e., non-formula) foods in their diet.</p>
<p><u>Children</u><br />
Most children have between 3 bowel movements per day  to 3 bowel movements per week.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/constipation-in-children/" class="faqquestion">What causes constipation?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Any change in a childâs normal routine including a  change in diet, a change in activity level or a different bathroom can cause  constipation. Although it can start without any clear cause, there are certain  times when a child is more likely to become constipated:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When  solid foods are introduced as an infant</li>
    <li> During  toilet training</li>
    <li> At  the start of school</li>
    <li> Birth  of a sibling</li>
    <li> Parents  separating or divorcing</li>
    <li>Move to a new place</li>
    <li> Travel away from home</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Whenever  bowel movements become hard, passing them becomes a painful and unpleasant  experience. The child then usually tries to avoid passing bowel movements by  holding them; this is also know as witholding.Â   This may eventually lead to larger, harder stools that worsen the  situation. The children may cross their legs, stand on toes, or squeeze their  buttocks together to try to avoid passing a bowel movement. Many times parents  misinterpret these behaviors as straining to pass stools when in reality the  children are trying not to have a bowel movement. These behaviors are called  retentive withholding.</p>
</div></li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/constipation-in-children/" class="faqquestion">Who is likely to develop chronic constipation?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">  
<p>It  is slightly more common in boys than girls. About 25-50% of children with  constipation will have a family member with similar problems. Children whose development  is delayed and those born with problems affecting the anus or rectum are more  likely to suffer from chronic constipation. Children with behavioral issues  such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may also have a higher chance  of being constipated.</p>
</div></li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/constipation-in-children/" class="faqquestion">What happens when my child is constipated?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">  
  <p>Constipation  may be associated with stomachaches or pain in other parts of the abdomen.  Constipation can result in tears of the anus called anal fissures. These tears  cause blood in the bowel movements. Because stools may be painful to pass over  an anal tear, children who have these tears may develop withholding behavior as  described above. Withholding can result in chronic constipation, soiling of the  underwear with stool and even difficulty walking. Soiling is usually an  indication of rectal impaction with stool. It often occurs when the child is  relaxed such as in a warm bathtub or sleeping and is not withholding. Soft,  âclay-likeâ stool then leaks around the ball of impacted stool in the rectum.  Children who are withholding their bowel movements often have a decreased  appetite and activity level.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/constipation-in-children/" class="faqquestion">Is my childâs constipation a sign that they have  another disease? </a>
<div class="faqanswer">  
<p>In over 90% of children,  constipation is not associated with other diseases. There are however certain  âred flagsâ or worrisome characteristics that should alert the physician that  another underlying disease should be considered and tested for. Diseases that  can have constipation as one of their symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Hirschsprung    âs disease â a  condition where the nerves of the large intestine (colon) are not properly  formed at birth</li>  
  <li>Thyroid problems â usually underactive thyroid</li>
  <li>Celiac disease â severe wheat  intolerance</li>
  <li>Lead poisoning</li>
  <li>Cystic fibrosis</li>
  <li>Spinal cord injury or  tethered cord (abnormal attachment of the spinal cord at birth)</li>
  <li>Hormonal problems that cause  abnormal blood calcium levels </li>
</ul>
  <p>Constipation can also be a side effect of a medicine  that the child is taking for another condition.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/constipation-in-children/" class="faqquestion">When should my child see a specialist about their constipation?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
  <p>If constipation does not go away or does not get  better after the treatment that your pediatrician prescribes, seeing a  pediatric gastroenterologist can be helpful. These specialists will obtain a  detailed history and perform a physical examination to distinguish constipation  that is due to withholding behavior from constipation due to an underlying  disease. While most children do not need any tests, your physician is the best  judge to decide which test if any is necessary and to provide the most  information about the cause of your childâs constipation.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/constipation-in-children/" class="faqquestion">What types of tests might my child have to determine what is causing their constipation?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Your doctor may suggest one or more of the following  special tests for constipation:</p>
  <p><strong>Plain x-ray of the abdomen (also known as a KUB)</strong><br />
This is a single or set of x-rays that can give your  physician a rough idea if there is a lot of stool present. It may also indicate  if the colon is dilated. This type of x-ray is also obtained prior to a barium  enema which is described below.</p>
  <p><strong>Anorectal manometry or motility test</strong><br />
This test determines if the  nerves and muscles responsible for passing a bowel movement are working  together. It is performed by inserting a very small balloon at the end of a  catheter into the rectum and blowing up the balloon. The response to inflating  the balloon determines if the nerves and muscles are working together  properly. Relaxation of the anal  muscles, known as the anal sphincter, after inflation of the balloon should  occur.</p>
  <p><strong>Barium enema</strong><br />
  This is an x-ray test where  barium or another type of contrast is inserted via a catheter into the rectum  and x-rays of the abdomen are taken. The test may or may not require a special  bowel preparation to clean out the bowel before the test. This test is used to  diagnose a blockage in the intestine or an area that may be narrowed or  abnormal. It is also used in the diagnosis of Hirschsprungâs disease.</p>
  <p><strong>Rectal biopsy</strong><br />
This  is a test where a small (pinch) biopsy is performed from the lining of the  rectum to determine if normal nerve cells are present in its walls. The sample  of tissue that is obtained is examined under the microscope looking for  ganglion cells, which are special nerve cells.Â   If they are absent then the diagnosis of Hirschsprungâs disease is made.</p>
  <p><strong>Transit study or marker study</strong><br />
This test is performed to  determine if the reason for constipation is due to slow movement throughout the  colon or just in the last part of the colon known as the rectum. Plastic  markers, which can be seen on x-ray, are swallowed and then several x-rays are  performed over the next 4-7 days to determine how long it takes them to pass  through the GI tract. Patients with normal motility pass the majority (&gt;80%)  of the markers within 5 days. If the markers are not passed but are found to  remain throughout the colon, this suggests slow transit of the entire colon. If  the markers do not pass and are clustered in the rectum, this may indicate a  problem in the rectum only.</p>
  <p><strong>Colonoscopy</strong><br />
This is an endoscopy of the  lower GI tract.Â  This test is usually not  indicated for the evaluation of routine constipation in children. This test may  be helpful if children have blood in their bowel movements not due to a fissure  or straining or other concerns on history or physical exam to suggest  inflammatory bowel disease and is also used for placing a colonic manometry  catheter if necessary (see below).</p>
  <p><strong>Colonic manometry</strong><br />
This  is a specialized test done in children who have continued problems with  intractable constipation despite adequate medical therapy. It involves placing  a catheter at the time of colonoscopy to determine whether there are normal  contractions in all parts of the colon. The test requires a period of prolonged  monitoring of the contractions of the colon after placement of the catheter.  This test is used to establish the diagnosis of colonic pseudo-obstruction in  children, a very rare condition.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/constipation-in-children/" class="faqquestion">How is constipation treated in children?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The  best way to treat constipation is a combination of education, behavioral  modification, dietary modification and non-habit forming medications. If there  is an impaction of stool, which means a very large amount of stool in the  rectum, it needs to be evacuated first either by an enema or by a medication  given by mouth. Patients are then started on a maintenance medication for a few  months to soften the stools, and a program of bowel retraining is started. The  child is advised to sit on the potty after every major meal for 5-10 minutes  and try to have a bowel movement. Positive reinforcement (reward) is provided  if the child has a stool in the potty. Behavioral modification may be needed in  some patients. Some children, especially boys, tend to get so involved in  sports or playing video or computer games that they ignore the âurgeâ to have a  bowel movement. Postponing the event makes things worse in the long run.Â  The goal of treatment is to make having a  bowel movement pain free for the child by softening the stools. Consistency in  treatment is crucial for success.Â  This  can be frustrating for the child as well as the parent.Â  Punishment is discouraged because it  reinforces a negative association with stooling.Â  </p>
<p>Dietary and lifestyle changes may be helpful in  improving a patientâs symptoms. Increasing dietary fiber over 1 to 2 weeks is  often helpful, by increasing bulk that then stimulates colon contractions. This  strategy may take a while to work and in some cases of severe constipation may  make symptoms temporarily worse. </p>
  <p>High fiber foods include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bran</li>
    <li> Fresh  fruits: apricots, apples, pears, and melons</li>
    <li> Fresh  vegetables: asparagus, beans, broccoli, carrots, beets, cauliflower, other  greens</li>
    <li> Whole-wheat  products: cereals, breads, and pasta. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Fiber supplements are available if parents find their  children will not eat more fiber in their diet. There is little information to  recommend one product over another. A patient may have to try several before  finding one that is acceptable and that they are willing to take regularly.  Fiber supplements are given two times a day and must be taken with a sufficient  amount of water. Some patients may notice increased passage of gas while on  fiber supplements. It is essential to increase the amount of free water in the  diet as well for children with constipation except for infants in whom water  intoxication may occur. Consultation with a pediatric dietitian may help guide  parents as to the correct amount of fluid intake and fiber intake for their  child. Increasing a patientâs physical activity is also helpful to promote  regular bowel movements.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/constipation-in-children/" class="faqquestion">What types of medications are used in children?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
  <p>If  constipation does not get better with dietary and behavior modifications, stool  softeners are indicated. The two most common stool softeners used in children  are polyethylene glycol 3350 and lactulose.</p>
  <p>Polyethylene glycol has  become the most widely used medication for treating constipation in children.  It is a white powder that can be dissolved in juice, water or other liquids and  does not get absorbed by the body. It is tasteless, safe and non-habit  forming.Â  Children have soft, more  frequent stools on this medication.</p>
  <p><u>Lactulose</u> is  a prescription laxative that is made of a sugar that is not absorbed by the  intestines. It works by pulling water into the bowel movements that helps to  keep them soft. Because it is not absorbed, lactulose is not associated with  side effects except for increased gassiness and diarrhea if the dose of the  medicine is too high. Lactulose is not a stimulant and therefore the bowel does  not become dependent on it.</p>
  <p><u>Milk of Magnesia </u>is a mild stimulant laxative  that may be used at bedtime in children with mild constipation. It is available  over the counter without a prescription. The major limiting factor in its use  in children is its taste, even though it is now available in different flavors. </p>
  <p><u>Mineral oil</u>,  which is given mixed with juice or milk, acts as a lubricant to allow bowel  movements to pass easier. This type of medication is particularly useful in  toddlers who withhold their bowel movements. Older children may have leakage of  the oil in their underwear that may not be acceptable. This problem usually  goes away with decreasing the dose of mineral oil. Mineral oil should not be  given to children with neurologic problems who are at high risk for aspiration.  Flavored forms of mineral oil are also available. </p>
<p>Stimulant laxatives, such as senna or  bisacodyl, that cause the colon to have strong contractions, are not popular  with pediatricians or pediatric gastroenterologists due to the concerns that  they may damage the intestinal nerves if given over prolonged periods and that  patients may become dependent on them for stool passage. </p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/constipation-in-children/" class="faqquestion">Is surgery ever performed for treatment of  constipation?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p> Surgery is rarely needed for constipation. The exception to this is Hirschsprungâs  disease, which is treated with surgical removal of the portion of the bowel  where there are no normal nerves. Also, there are rare cases when children  develop a dilated and floppy colon that has no normal contractions, a condition  called pseudo-obstruction. These children also may benefit from removing the  affected colon surgically. Recently special surgical procedures, such as  cecostomy or appendicostomy placement (creating an opening between the bowel  and skin which allows administration of enemas âfrom aboveâ rather than from  below via the rectum), have been devised to help children with spinal cord and  other neurologic abnormalities that have severe problems with constipation.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Diarrhea is a very common  problem in children younger than age five. In developing or non-industrialized  countries, multiple episodes of diarrhea can lead to serious problems such as  malnutrition (poor nutrition). In the United States and Canada, young children  have an average of two episodes of diarrhea per year.</p>

<p>Diarrhea is defined as an increase in the number of stools  or the presence of looser stools than is normal for the individual, i.e. more  than three bowel movements each day. Acute diarrhea is when diarrhea occurs for  less than 3 weeks total. When diarrhea  lasts longer than three weeks, it is considered to be chronic.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Diarrhea may be watery or  contain blood. Stool may float which may indicate that there is increased fat  present in the stool. Diarrhea may also be accompanied by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Urgency with  bowel movements, which means that children feel that they have to get to the  bathroom immediately or they will have an accident.</li>
  <li>Abdominal pain  and/or bloating</li>
  <li>Rectal pain</li>
  <li>Nausea and/or  vomiting</li>
  <li>Weight loss</li>
  <li>Fever</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals with diarrhea are  at risk for dehydration, which occurs when someone is unable to take in  sufficient fluid orally to meet  their daily requirements and compensate for losses in their stools. Signs of dehydration include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>decrease in urine  output/wet diapers</li>
  <li>dry lips and  mouth</li>
  <li>lack of tears  when crying</li>
  <li>increased  irritability and fussiness</li>
  <li>increased  sleepiness/decreased energy level</li>
</ul>
<p>Physicians can determine if  someone is dehydrated and how severely they are dehydrated by examining them.  Parents can monitor children for signs of dehydration.</p>

			<wp:meta_key><![CDATA[_acg_gi_patients_cpt_basics_sectioncontent_3]]></wp:meta_key>
			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p><strong>Acute Diarrhea</strong><br />
Acute diarrhea may be due to infections with bacteria,  viruses or parasites. Diarrhea is more common in children attending day care  and is usually due to a virus. While cases of diarrhea due to infection are  usually mild and go away on their own, it is important to avoid becoming  dehydrated from loss of body fluid in diarrheal stools.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Chronic Diarrhea</strong><br />
There are many causes of  chronic diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea is due to a disease that causes inflammation  of the bowel and/or malabsorption of nutrients.</p>
<p>Common causes of chronic  diarrhea are shown below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Diarrhea  following infection (post infectious diarrhea):<br />
   â Infections such  as giardia can lead to chronic diarrhea</li>
  <li>Chronic  nonspecific diarrhea:<br />
   â Seen in toddlers  and is usually dietary in origin, such as from drinking too much juice or  carbohydrate sweetened liquids such as sports drinks or other products. It  resolves by simply limiting the amount of juice or carbohydrate sweetened  liquid intake.</li>
  <li>Celiac disease  (gluten intolerance):<br />
   â With an estimated  incidence of 1:133 individuals, Celiac disease presents with chronic symptoms  including constipation, diarrhea, poor weight gain, decreased energy, and  abdominal distension. Children with type I diabetes and other autoimmune  disorders as well as Downâs syndrome are at increased risk for Celiac disease.</li>
  <li>Inflammatory  bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease):<br />
   â A disease where  there is inflammation of the intestines and/or colon that can lead to chronic  diarrhea. Other symptoms include weight loss or poor weight gain, poor growth  and abdominal pain. </li>
  <li>Lactose  intolerance:<br />
   â An inability to  digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and milk products, can lead to chronic  diarrhea. Other symptoms include abdominal pain and distention, excessive  burping and gas.</li>
  <li>Irritable bowel  syndrome:<br />
   â A common cause of  diarrhea in teenagers, although many patients will present with abdominal pain  and diarrhea that alternates with constipation.</li>
  <li>Diarrhea after  antibiotic use (antibiotic associated colitis):<br />
  â Diarrhea can be  seen after antibiotic use and is thought to be due to an imbalance between the  âgood and badâ bacteria in the intestine. One such bacterium is called <em>Clostridium  difficile</em>.</li>
  <li>Food allergies:<br />
   â Food allergies  can present with diarrhea as well as skin rashes, abdominal pain, poor growth,  nausea and vomiting.</li>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Risk  factors for infectious causes of diarrhea include travel to foreign countries,  swimming in lakes and ponds, attendance at day care, foster home and school as  well as sick contacts at home. Recent antibiotic use can also put individuals  at risk for developing diarrhea. Celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease  (IBD) have been associated with certain genes and families with first-degree  relatives with these diseases are at greater risk.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p><u>Acute Diarrhea</u><br />
Diarrhea due to acute infection (acute gastroenteritis)  usually does not require tests. In some cases doctors will order blood tests to  determine if a child is dehydrated. Collection of stool samples (stool  cultures) can be done to identify the specific cause of the diarrhea in some  children, especially if they have blood in stools.Â  Stool cultures can take from 2 to 5 days  before a result is available. Stool studies can also be done to look for  parasites including Giardia. In many cases of acute infectious diarrhea, a  precise cause will not be identified despite stool testing.</p>
  <p><u>Chronic Diarrhea</u><br />
The diagnosis of chronic diarrhea usually requires  confirmatory tests. Establishing the exact cause of chronic diarrhea may  require several different tests, some of which are listed below:
<ul>
  <li>Blood tests to  look for anemia and inflammation, assess for dehydration and nutrition status  and screen for possible Celiac disease.</li>
  <li>Stool studies to  look for possible bacterial, viral or parasitic etiologies.</li>
  <li>X-ray studies are  not routinely performed but may be useful in some circumstances to evaluate the  liver and gastrointestinal tract if other causes are suspected.</li>
  <li>Upper endoscopy and/or  colonoscopy with biopsy to access for inflammation. An upper endoscopy can help  to definitively diagnose Celiac disease. A colonoscopy is invaluable in making the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel  disease and figuring out what portion of the colon is involved with the  inflammation. It can also help to diagnose diarrhea that follows antibiotic use  and to diagnose rare conditions such as lymphocytic colitis.</li>
  <li>Lactose breath  hydrogen test to diagnose lactose intolerance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your  physician can assist you in choosing the best treatment after determining the  cause of your childâs diarrhea.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p><u>Ensure Adequate Hydration</u><br />
Children with mild  dehydration can be treated outside of the hospital with special oral  rehydration solutions (ORS) that can be purchased at the pharmacy or grocery  store. Oral rehydration solutions are the best way to rehydrate a child who is  able to drink and is not vomiting. Although other drinks such as juices, colas  and sports drinks are frequently used, they are not a good substitute for ORS,  and can actually worsen the diarrhea. Patients with more severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration may require  intravenous fluids (fluids given through a vein in the arm) in the hospital.</p>
<p><u>Diet</u><br />
  In a child who is otherwise healthy, it is very important  to start feeding them their regular diet as soon as possible. Breast fed  infants should be nursed normally during episodes of acute gastroenteritis.  Formula fed infants can continue their regular diet and older children should  be re-introduced to their regular diet as soon as possible. Older children may  avoid dairy initially and try a bland diet consisting of bananas, apple sauce,  rice, and toast. </p>
<p><u>Medications</u><br />
  Antibiotics may be prescribed for children with specific  bacterial or parasitic illnesses, although in most cases antibiotics do not  change how long the diarrhea lasts or its severity. Probiotics (commercially  manufactured tablets or capsules that contain âgood bacteriaâ) may be useful in  decreasing the severity of symptoms in the presence of an imbalance of good and  bad bacteria in the intestines. Medications that slow down bowel movements are  not recommended in children with acute diarrhea although they may occasionally play  a role in children with chronic diarrhea.</p>
<p><u>Supportive Care</u><br />
  Careful hand washing should be practiced by all family  members especially after diaper changes.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-children/" class="faqquestion">What is gastroesophageal reflux?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Gastroesophageal reflux is the bringing up or  regurgitation of stomach contents or acid into the esophagus (the swallowing  tube). Almost everyone refluxes at some point during the day especially after  meals. What distinguishes normal reflux from pathologic or abnormal reflux is  how often reflux occurs and if it causes symptoms or damage to the esophagus.  Reflux is being increasingly recognized in children and adolescents. Although the  symptoms in teenagers may be similar to those seen in adults, the symptoms in  infants and younger children may differ enough so that they are not recognized  as being due to reflux.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Almost all infants reflux or regurgitate a portion of  their feeding at one time or another. What distinguishes normal regurgitation  from abnormal regurgitation is how often the reflux occurs, if it is associated  with discomfort, and if it results in other complications. These complications  include poor weight gain known as âfailure to thriveâ, breathing difficulties  such as infrequent breaths or apnea, asthma  symptoms such as wheezing, or a hoarse voice or cry. Other complications of  reflux are aspiration, which is when the refluxed stomach contents reach the  lungs, pneumonia due to aspiration, or inflammation of the esophagus called  esophagitis. Spitting up blood or material that looks like old âcoffee groundsâ  is rarely seen and requires immediate evaluation by a physician. </p>
<p>Reflux symptoms in infants tend to improve as they get  older, usually by 12 to 15 months of age. This is because as infants get older  their stomach is able to empty quicker and their esophagus lengthens, therefore  there is less material in the stomach to regurgitate. Infants who reflux or  regurgitate will not necessarily have problems with reflux as they get older or  as adults.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-children/" class="faqquestion">Is vomiting in my baby always due to gastroesophageal  reflux?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There are a number of reasons<strong>,</strong> other than reflux, that a baby may vomit. Babies may be allergic to the milk or soy protein that  they are getting in their formula, or proteins in their motherâs diet if they  are breast fed and this can result in irritability, vomiting, poor weight gain  and blood in the bowel movements. This is treated with a change to a  specialized formula where the proteins are broken down to make them less  allergenic (allergy causing). Babies can be born with problems where the  intestine is not formed or positioned properly or is blocked. These types of  problems are usually found in the immediate newborn period but can present  later in some infants. A combination of x-rays and or endoscopy (looking at the lining of the stomach and upper  intestine and/or colon with a long tube with a video camera at the tip) is  usually helpful to make this diagnosis.</p>
<p>Between 4-8 weeks of age infants can develop a  condition known as pyloric stenosis. This results in significant and forceful  vomiting and is usually associated with poor weight gain and possibly weight  loss. Parents of infants with this problem describe their childâs vomiting as  projectile. Pyloric stenosis is currently treated with surgery. There are other  non-gastrointestinal causes of vomiting in infants and young children including  hormonal problems, kidney problems and problems with increased pressure on the  brain. These are unusual conditions but patients should be tested for these  problems if their physician feels that their symptoms are not typical or they  are not responding to treatment for their reflux.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-children/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of reflux in older children and  adolescents?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Reflux  symptoms in children are variable. Children may be unable to communicate  typical reflux symptoms such as heartburn. They may complain of generalized  abdominal pain, frequently around the area of the belly button and on occasion  may complain of chest pain. Often children will report a feeling that they need  to throw up and on occasion will describe that they get a taste in their mouth  as if they have thrown up. Other children will report that they feel that the  food is coming back up and that they then re-swallow it. Occasionally they will  report a feeling that food is not going down correctly or feels like it is  getting stuck. Some patients may complain of asthma symptoms such as cough or  wheezing that are worsened by reflux. Even though children may not relate  reflux symptoms to eating, obtaining a dietary history for foods and medicines  that may trigger or worsen reflux is important.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-children/" class="faqquestion">How is the diagnosis of reflux made?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Reflux is usually diagnosed based on symptoms and physical examination. X-rays are  generally not helpful in diagnosing abnormal reflux although they are often  used to exclude other problems that may mimic reflux. Performing an upper intestinal<strong> </strong>endoscopy with  biopsies can be helpful to determine if inflammation of the esophagus is  present. The test currently considered most helpful in making the diagnosis of  acid reflux is a pH/ impedance probe. This probe is a small tube inserted  through the nose into the esophagus that continuously measures how often acid  is being regurgitated into the esophagus. There are normal expected values for  both children and adults.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/gastroesophageal-reflux-in-children/" class="faqquestion">What are treatment choices for children and  adolescents with gastroesophageal reflux?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There are many medications available to treat  gastroesophageal reflux. Many of these medications have been used successfully  to treat children. Dosages of medication must be modified for a childâs weigh  and they require monitoring to reduce possible long-term side effects. The most  common medications reduce or turn off the production of acid in the  stomach.Â They include H2  blockers and proton pump inhibitors (PPis).Â Other medications include agents that help empty the stomach.Â Diet is an important part of reflux  management and children and teenagers with reflux should avoid the products  listed below. Medications such as aspirin, ibuprofen, nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) and alcohol based products should be  avoided if possible in children with reflux. Rarely a surgical procedure called  a fundoplication (or wrap) is required for severe reflux. This procedure is  usually reserved for patients with severe symptoms or complications of reflux  that do not respond to standard medications and dietary treatment.Â  </p>
<p><u>Foods to avoid if you have  reflux</u></p>
<p>Spicy, acidic or tomato based  foods<br />
  Fatty foods<br />
  Citrus products including  citrus juices<br />
  Apple juice <br />
  Caffeinated drinks â cola,  tea, coffee, hot chocolate<br />
Chocolate and licorice</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/" class="faqquestion">What is inflammatory bowel  disease?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to a chronic  (long term/ lifelong) inflammation or irritation of the stomach, small  intestine and/or colon (large bowel). Inflammatory bowel disease should not be  confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). There are two types or categories  of inflammatory bowel disease, Ulcerative Colitis and Crohnâs disease. Patients  can have either type but not both. Occasionally one type of inflammatory bowel  disease is diagnosed and with further testing or time the disease may be  re-diagnosed as the other type.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/" class="faqquestion">What is the difference between ulcerative colitis and  Crohnâs disease?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Ulcerative colitis and Crohnâs disease differ  primarily in the portions of the bowel that they each involve and also the  layers of the bowel wall that are involved. Ulcerative colitis involves only  the large bowel. It can involve a part of the large bowel only or the entire  large bowel but it does not have âskipâ areas. Skip areas are areas of the  intestine that are normal with abnormal areas on either side of them.  Ulcerative colitis only involves the innermost layer of the bowel (the lining  of the bowel) known as the mucosa. It does not involve deeper layers of the bowel.  Crohnâs disease on the other hand can involve any area of the gastrointestinal  tract from the mouth to the rectum (the last portion of the colon) and the  anus. Crohnâs disease involves not only the lining of the bowel, but can and  usually does involve the deeper layers of the bowel. Even though Crohnâs  disease can involve any portion of the gastrointestinal tract it typically does  not involve every portion of the gastrointestinal tract. The most common sites  of involvement are the end of the small intestine known as the terminal ileum,  involved in up to 80% of patients, involvement in the colon in approximately  50% of patients, with approximately 5% of patients having disease in their  stomach or first part of the small intestine known as the duodenum.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/" class="faqquestion">How common is ulcerative colitis and Crohnâs disease  in pediatric patients?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
  <p>Both ulcerative colitis and Crohnâs disease are  relatively uncommon problems in both children and adults. The incidence or  number of new cases occurring each year appears to be increasing more for  Crohnâs disease than for ulcerative colitis. In a group of approximately  100,000 children age 15 years or younger, it is estimated that approximately 2  or 3 of them will develop Crohnâs disease each year. However in a group of  100,000 children age 15-19, the rate of developing Crohnâs disease increases to  16 new cases per year. The chance of developing ulcerative colitis in childhood  and adolescence is less than the chance of developing Crohnâs disease, with an  incidence of 2 to 10 new cases per 100,000 populations per year. The teenage  years are one of the most likely times for inflammatory bowel disease to be  diagnosed. The other most common time is between 30-40 years of age. </p>
  <p>Both ulcerative colitis and Crohnâs disease are more  common in certain families. In large studies it has been shown that if someone  has either ulcerative colitis or Crohnâs and all of their close family members  (parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and children) are followed for a  period of thirty years there is a one in three chance of at least one other  family member developing either ulcerative colitis or Crohnâs disease.Â  The chance of a child or a sibling of a patient  with IBD developing IBD is approximately 8%. If the original family member has  ulcerative colitis the relative is likely to develop ulcerative colitis and if  they have Crohn's disease the relative is likely to develop Crohn's.Â  Neither ulcerative colitis nor Crohnâs  disease are contagious, which means that you cannot catch it from your family  member. The reason for family members being more likely to develop these  diseases is probably due to inheriting a gene that makes an individual more  susceptible to develop this type of inflammation of the bowel. In addition to  being more common in certain families, both ulcerative colitis and Crohnâs  disease are more common in certain ethnic groups, especially Jewish individuals  of eastern European descent.Â Â Â  </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of Ulcerative Colitis in  children and teenagers?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
  <p>The most common symptoms of ulcerative colitis in  children and teenagers are diarrhea, blood in the bowel movements and pain in  the abdomen. Patients with this condition may have pain prior to a bowel  movement that improves after a bowel movement, and frequent bowel movements up  to 10 times per day or more. Patients may also feel that they need to have a  bowel movement immediately or they are going to have an accident. Having bowel  movements at night is not uncommon in patients with ulcerative colitis, especially  when the colon is more inflamed. Other symptoms in children can include anemia  (a low blood count), weight loss and poor growth, although the later two are  more common with longstanding disease and more likely to occur with Crohnâs  disease.Â  </p>
</div>
</li>
 
<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/" class="faqquestion">What are the symptoms of Crohnâs disease in children  and teenagers?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The symptoms of Crohnâs disease may be more subtle  than those of ulcerative colitis or may be dramatic. Abdominal pain, diarrhea  and weight loss are the most common symptoms occurring in 65-75% of patients.  Poor growth is also common and a very important sign of pediatric Crohnâs  disease. A child who is usually amongst the tallest in their class who becomes  amongst the smallest, especially around the time of puberty may have Crohnâs  disease. The average time between the first symptoms of Crohnâs disease and the  diagnosis of Crohnâs disease may be up to a year due to the subtle first  symptoms of Crohnâs disease. Fatigue or being tired due to anemia is common as  is blood in the bowel movements, although less common than in ulcerative  colitis. Up to 25% of patients will have disease around their bottom or anus;  this may go unrecognized in a teenager who is uncomfortable discussing bowel  issues with their parents or doctors. This includes extra folds of skin (skin  tags), which may become inflamed, drainage of pus from small openings in the  skin known as fistulas and fissures or cracks in the skin around the anus,  which can be painful.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Although the stomach, small intestine and colon are  the areas of the body that are most commonly involved with inflammatory bowel  disease, patients can develop symptoms outside of the GI tract that are due to  their inflammatory bowel disease. How severe the symptoms are may in some cases  be related to how severe the bowel disease is or may be independent of the  bowel symptoms. These symptoms are generally not due to medications  administered for the bowel disease. The table below indicates some of the most  common extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/" class="faqquestion">How is the diagnosis made of ulcerative colitis or  Crohnâs disease? </a>
<div class="faqanswer">
  <p>After a careful history and physical examination your  doctor can order blood work to screen for ulcerative colitis or Crohnâs  disease. Blood work that would be abnormal in these conditions can include a  blood count demonstrating anemia, especially if the iron level is low, an  increased white blood cell count which may indicate inflammation or infection,  an increased platelet count (the part of the blood that is responsible for  helping blood clot), decreased blood levels of proteins such as albumin and an  elevated sedimentation rate, or CRP value, nonspecific markers of inflammation.  There are additional blood tests available that detect certain antibodies found  more commonly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. However, testing positive  or negative for these antibodies does not establish or rule out the diagnosis  of inflammatory bowel disease and therefore expert interpretation of these  blood tests is required. </p>
  <p>An x-ray called an upper GI with small bowel follow  through can be obtained to look for irregularity in the small intestine. This  is particularly helpful in pediatric patients, as the terminal ileum, which is  the end of the small intestine, is the site most commonly abnormal in children  with Crohnâs disease. </p>
  <p>Endoscopy with biopsy (taking samples of tissue) also  known as performing a scope test is the definitive way to diagnose inflammatory  bowel disease and also to determine how much of the colon is involved.  Colonoscopy, examining the colon as well as the end of the small intestine is  the test most commonly performed in pediatric patients suspected of having  either UC or Crohnâs disease. Endoscopy can also be performed of the stomach  and first part of the small intestine in patients suspected of having Crohn's  disease. </p>
<p>In addition, wireless capsule endoscopy can be used in  pediatric patients suspected of having Crohnâs disease in whom the diagnosis is  not established by upper endoscopy and colonoscopy, or in patients with a known  diagnosis to establish how much of the small intestine is involved. This test  is performed by having patients swallow a large capsule which takes video  images as it travels through the digestive tract. Capsule endoscopy is most  easily accomplished in older children and adolescents who can more readily  swallow the capsule endoscope. This test should be avoided in children known or  suspected to have a stricture of the intestines as this can cause the capsule  to get stuck which may require surgery to remove it.Â Â  </p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/" class="faqquestion">What are the treatment options for Ulcerative colitis  and Crohnâs disease?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There are a variety of medications available to treat  both ulcerative colitis and Crohnâs disease. Important pediatric considerations  for medical therapy include long term side effects of the medications  especially with regards to growth, bone disease such as osteoporosis (decreased  calcium in the bone), development of cataracts in the eyes from medications  such as steroids and a small risk of developing certain types of cancer with  some medications or as a result of having chronic inflammatory bowel disease  over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Medications used for pediatric patients with  inflammatory bowel disease include the following: </p>
<table>
<tr>

<th align="center">How it is given</th>

<tr>
<td>Aminosalicylate or 5-ASA products</td>
<td align="center">by mouth, as a suppository or an enema</td>

<td align="center">in the vein or by injection</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>There are a variety of  nutritional options also available for patients with Crohnâs disease and it has  been shown that disease activity appears to decrease if patients are able to  significantly increase their caloric intake through the use of standard or  specialized diets. Supplementation with folic acid, calcium and Vitamin D in  patients with decreased bone calcium is also helpful in pediatric patients with  inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/" class="faqquestion">What is the role of surgery in ulcerative colitis or  Crohn's disease?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Colorectal surgery is curative for ulcerative colitis,  but not for Crohn's disease. Surgery is usually performed for disease that does  not get better despite medications, if severe medication side effects develop  or for other complications of the underlying inflammatory bowel disease. Children undergoing removal of their colon for ulcerative colitis can have a  pouch fashioned of small intestine that serves as a reservoir for stool and  takes the place of the rectum. Children undergoing surgery for Crohnâs disease  generally do so for development of a specific complication of their disease or  their medication. Because Crohnâs disease always comes back following surgery  given a long enough period of follow up, patients are usually continued on  maintenance medications to cut down how quickly or how severely the disease  comes back. Also the amount of bowel removed is limited in patients with  Crohnâs disease in order to prevent additional problems with absorption of  nutrients after surgery. Patients still require regular follow up with their  gastroenterologist after surgery for either ulcerative colitis or Crohnâs  disease. </p>
<p>The development of colon cancer appears to be a long  term risk of having either ulcerative colitis or Crohnâs disease and in some  cases appears to relate to the number of years of disease. (i.e. number of  years following diagnosis) Disease starting in childhood may be a particular  risk factor and therefore pediatric patients with both UC and Crohnâs disease  require regular follow up with a gastroenterologist throughout their life to  help reduce the risk of developing serious complications including colon  cancer.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Lactose is the sugar found in  milk and dairy products such as cheese and yogurt. After eating dairy products  that contain this sugar, usually lactase, a digestive enzyme of the small  intestine, helps to breakdown this complex sugar into two simple sugars, glucose  and galactose. These simple sugars are then absorbed in the small intestine and  ultimately reach the blood stream where they act as nutrients. The enzyme  lactase is located in the lining  of the small intestine known as the intestinal villi. </p>
<p>In addition to milk and dairy  products such as ice cream, yogurt and cheese, lactose can be found in bread  and baked goods, processed breakfast cereals, instant potatoes, some soups and  non-kosher lunch meats, candies, dressings and mixes for pancakes and biscuits.  Lactose is also the sugar found in breast milk and standard infant formulas.  Therefore almost all babies are able to digest and absorb this sugar and it  serves as their primary dietary sugar.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Because lactose is not  digested properly in the small intestine of individuals who are lactose  intolerant, it passes whole into the large intestine or colon. Upon reaching  the colon it is broken down by the normal colon bacteria. This breakdown  results in the production of carbon dioxide and hydrogen gases. The gas  production can lead to the following common symptoms:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Abdominal distension and pain</li>
    <li>Excess burping</li>
    <li>Loud bowel sounds</li>
    <li>Excess gas and diarrhea following ingestion of lactose. </li>
    <li>Watery and explosive bowel movements</li>
    <li>Urgency with bowel movements, which means that children  feel that they have to get to the bathroom immediately or they will have an  accident.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The symptoms of lactose intolerance can start during  childhood or adolescence and tend to get worse with age. The severity of  symptoms is usually proportional to the amount of the milk sugar ingested with  more symptoms following a meal with higher milk sugar content. </p>
  <p>Although eating lactose-containing  products will result in discomfort for someone who is lactose intolerant, they are  not at risk of developing more serious intestinal disease because of long-term  lactose malabsorption. The only exception to this would be for babies who are  born with primary lactase deficiency or children with secondary lactase  deficiency as discussed below. </p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_key><![CDATA[_acg_gi_patients_cpt_basics_sectioncontent_3]]></wp:meta_key>
			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[  <p><strong>Primary Lactase Deficiency:</strong> This condition is very rare and occurs when babies are born with a deficiency  or absence of the enzyme lactase. Babies inherit this condition by getting one  gene that causes this problem from each of their parents, even though both  parents may be lactose tolerant. These babies require a specialized formula  with another type of sugar such as sucrose (present in table sugar), which they are able to digest.</p>

  <p><strong>Secondary Lactase Deficiency:</strong> The most common cause of temporary lactose intolerance in infants and young  children is infection that affects the gastrointestinal tract and can damage  the lining of the small intestine. </p>
  <p>Rotavirus and Giardia are two  common organisms that cause damage to the surface of the small intestine  resulting in temporary lactose intolerance. Older infants and young children  will commonly be infected by a rotavirus. The symptoms of rotavirus infection  include vomiting, diarrhea (frequent watery stools), and fever. Giardia is a  parasite that is found in well water and fresh water from lakes and streams.  Treatment of giardia infection with antibiotics will resolve the lactose  intolerance. </p>
  <p>Secondary lactase deficiency  can also be due to Celiac disease, which is an intolerance to gluten, the  protein found in wheat, rye, barley and other grains.Â Crohn disease, an inflammatory condition that  can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract can lead to secondary lactase  deficiency as well. Once each of these conditions is treated, the lactase  deficiency will resolve. The lactose intolerance usually resolves within three  to four weeks when the lining of the intestines returns to normal.</p>
  <p><strong>Acquired Lactase Deficiency:</strong> Many  individuals acquire lactose intolerance as they get older. It is estimated that  approximately one half of adults in the United States have acquired lactase  deficiency. This condition is due to a normal decline in the amount of the  enzyme lactase present in the small intestine as we age. Although lactose is an  important part of the diet in infants and young children it represents only 10%  of the carbohydrate (sugar) intake in adults. However, individuals who are  lactose intolerant may not be able to tolerate even small amounts of this sugar  in their diet.</p>
<p>Lactose intolerance occurs  more frequently in certain families. One of the most important factors  affecting the rate of developing lactose intolerance is an individualâs ethnic  background. Approximately 15% of adult Caucasians, and 85% of adult African Americans  in the United States are lactose intolerant. The rate of lactose intolerance is  also very high in individuals of Asian descent, Hispanic descent, Native  Americans and Jewish individuals. </p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Lactose intolerance is  diagnosed by a simple test called a hydrogen breath test. After a overnight  fast before the test, an individual breathes into a bag and then drinks a  specified amount of the milk sugar as a syrup. In adults this corresponds to  the amount of milk sugar in a quart of milk.Â   Subsequent breath samples are taken for up to three hours. The breath  that they exhale into the bag is analyzed to determine its hydrogen content.  During the course of the test individuals who are lactose intolerant will have  an increase in the amount of hydrogen that they exhale. If the values for  hydrogen increase above a certain value the diagnosis of lactose intolerance is  made. Patients who are lactose intolerant may also develop their typical  symptoms during the test.Â Â Â Â Â  </p>
  <p>In younger children or in  children who cannot tolerate the breath test, removal of lactose from the diet  and possible supplementation with lactase can be done for 2-4 weeks to see if  this improves the symptoms.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The best treatment of lactose  intolerance is a combination of dietary modification and taking a supplement to  aid in digestion of lactose. Individuals who are lactose intolerant should meet  with a dietician to review the sources of lactose in their diet. Some reduction  in the daily lactose consumption is usually required. When an individual is  going to be eating a food that contains lactose they should take a commercially  available non-prescription lactase supplement at the time of lactose ingestion.  This type of supplement can be taken throughout the day whenever lactose is  ingested. Some individuals will be less lactose intolerant and therefore will  be able to tolerate comparatively larger amounts of lactose. Alternatives to  milk for lactose intolerant individuals include products such as soy milk. If  an individual is restricting their milk/ dairy intake it is important to ensure  adequate supplementation of calcium and Vitamin D in the diet. This is  especially important for pediatric patients and women.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>A womanâs unique experience of symptoms starts with the tongue and goes through the entire digestive tract. More women can be classified as âsupertastersâ â they are able to taste both bitter and sweet foods more strongly than men. They don't need as much of the food to determine if the food is bitter or sweet. This increased sensitivity of the gut to different types of stimulation is seen throughout a woman's GI tract. Normal women have been shown to be more sensitive to pressure from an inflated balloon placed in the esophagus (swallowing tube between the mouth and the stomach), small intestine, colon or large intestine, and rectum than men. Through each area of the digestive tract, we will talk about symptoms unique to women, their causes, risk factors, testing and treatment.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>The GI tract muscles in women may function differently compared with men. Between the end of the esophagus and the beginning of the stomach, there is a muscle which acts like a door. When one eats, the door opens allowing the food to slide into the stomach and then quickly closes again, preventing the food from flowing back up into the esophagus. The muscle in women, especially premenopausal women, squeezes shut with more force than that found in men, making certain that the food and stomach juices stay in the stomach. There is a similar muscle protecting the windpipe from esophageal backflow. In women, tests have shown that after drinking fluids, this muscle tightens more than in men. In part due to this finding, women may have more occurrences of âglobusâ (the feeling of a âlump in the throatâ) that is not necessarily associated with swallowing food. However, overall these strong muscles suggest that women may have some extra protection in the esophagus, normally. </p>
<p>Although women may experience heartburn, they generally have less damage in their esophagus than men. Women secrete less stomach acid than men, throughout their lives and they tend to have fewer ulcers related to acid. The stronger muscles at the end of the esophagus and the lesser amount of stomach acid present in women may help to explain the milder damage to the esophagus. However, because women are more sensitive to irritants, they may experience heartburn more strongly than men. Several things can precipitate <u>heartburn</u> symptoms, including spicy or acidic foods, caffeine, large meals, obesity, or eating prior to lying down. The treatment for heartburn includes modification of any precipitating factors followed by a trial of an acid-suppression medication if symptoms persist. There is data suggesting that prolonged duration of higher-dosed acid-suppressive medication may increase the risk of osteoporosis. This risk can be discussed with your doctor before starting the medication. For refractory cases of heartburn, an endoscopy (a procedure that involves looking into the esophagus and stomach with a small camera) is often indicated to exclude other diagnoses.</p>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Women also seem to have slower emptying of food from the stomach than men. This may be important in explaining why women tend to experience nausea and bloating more frequently than men. Certain conditions including diabetes, prior stomach surgeries, infections, medications, and low thyroid levels can cause damage to nerves that are responsible for gastric emptying, leading to a condition called <u>gastroparesis (delayed gastric emptying)</u>. Common symptoms include abdominal bloating, nausea, fullness and weight loss. The diagnosis requires testing by your doctor. The treatment involves eating smaller, more frequent meals that are lower in fat. Although medications may be prescribed by your doctor, options are limited due to drug side effects.</p>
<p>Another stomach problem that may affect women includes inflammation of the stomach <u>(known as gastritis)</u>. Many women use aspirin and aspirin-like compounds, known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); ibuprofen is included in this class of medications. Some NSAIDs are available in over-the-counter form while others require a prescription. Women, especially older women, use these medications more often than men for a variety of reasons. These drugs, if used persistently, are known to cause irritation to the stomach lining and may lead to bleeding from ulcers. In recent years, new types of prescription NSAIDs have become available, such as COX-2 inhibitors, which reportedly have less adverse effects on the GI tract, but have been linked to an increase in heart attacks. All patients should discuss with their doctors if the COX-2 inhibitors are right for them. Women should tell their doctors if they are using NSAIDs, whether prescribed or purchased in a drugstore, in order to develop a regimen to help protect their stomach.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Women also have slower emptying from the large intestine when compared with men but this difference disappears in old age. This may be important in explaining why women tend to be more constipated than men. Additionally, at the end of the rectum, the anal sphincter is the muscle that allows us to delay moving our bowels until we find an appropriate place, such as a bathroom. When physicians evaluate the function of the anal sphincter, they measure squeeze pressure - how firmly the patient can squeeze the muscle shut. Most investigators agree that women have less squeeze pressure than men. The anal canal (the passage from the opening to the rectum) is shorter in women and the length of both the sphincter and area of highest pressure is also shorter in women. Men tolerate more volume in the rectal area. Overall, men anatomically should be better able to handle an episode of diarrhea than women.</p>
<p><u>Chronic constipation</u> is common in women and tends to worsen with age. Treatment includes at least 20-35 grams of dietary fiber per day, adequate fluid intake, and regular exercise. Non-prescription medications may include stool softeners and laxatives. If you donât respond to these therapies, your doctor may order additional testing or medications.</p>
<p><u>Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)</u> occurs 2 to 6 times more often in women than in men. In patients with IBS, there is super-sensitivity to irritants (such as intestinal gas) that would not be bothersome to other people. The etiology is believed to be due to the way intestinal nerves send messages to the brain, the interpretation that the brain makes, and its response back to the gut. If a person has emotional stress, the IBS response appears to be worse. The good news is that there is no damage to the intestinal lining. This is a âfunctionalâ problem - that is, the bowel is not functioning at a normal level, but at a super- or suboptimal level. Symptoms often include diarrhea, constipation or combination of both. Bloating and abdominal pain are part of the syndrome, and often improve after bowel movements. The diagnosis is made based upon specific criteria and lack of other objective findings. Currently, there is no one treatment to cure this disorder, but many effective management strategies exist. Lifestyle changes are recommended, which include the development of coping strategies for life stressors. This is a chronic condition and many patients have reached satisfactory results working with their physicians as a team.</p>
<p><u>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)</u> includes both Crohnâs and Ulcerative Colitis.  IBD is more frequent in women with a ratio of about 2:1. Women may have a milder course of Crohnâs, especially if they have given birth to several children. Hormones during pregnancy could improve or worsen the disease; this is not similar for all subsequent pregnancies in the same patient. Symptoms may include diarrhea, blood in the stool, weight loss, and anemia. Diagnosis is generally made after colonoscopy and review of biopsy specimens by pathology. Treatment can vary but often requires long-term medications, many of which are safe in pregnancy.</p>
<p><u>Colon cancer</u> is the number 3 cancer for women in the United States. Women should be advised to follow current guidelines to be screened at age 50, and talk to their doctors if they have a family history of the disease, in which case they should be screened at an earlier age and at more frequent intervals. Patients should discuss screening options with the doctor to determine the best individual screening option. There are familial colon cancer syndromes that are also associated with uterine, ovarian and breast cancers, so if several of these cancers are found within a family, genetic counseling should be offered.</p>

This effect is exaggerated during pregnancy due to unique female hormones, and may be one reason why many women develop gallstones after having a baby. Symptoms of gallbladder disease may include right upper abdominal pain after eating, nausea or vomiting. Gallbladder disease can often be diagnosed by your doctor based upon history and ultrasound results.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>There are two areas where women have different enzyme systems from men where the effect can be important. There are enzymes in the small intestine as well as in the liver that help break down medications. The enzymes function slightly differently in men and women. Because of this, women may handle various medications differently, resulting in either little effect of the drug or too much effect of the drug. Therefore, it is important that patients ask their doctors if medications that they prescribe may behave differently in women.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Pregnancy is associated with nausea, which occurs early in the pregnancy. This effect may result from a slowing of stomach emptying, beyond what is seen normally in women. One of the pregnancy hormones, progesterone, is associated with delaying muscle contraction, and it is believed that this is a major cause of the nausea seen with pregnancy. Women also experience heartburn during pregnancy. This seems to be caused by the increasing levels of progesterone during pregnancy as well as the increasing size of the baby. It is most prominent during the second half of the pregnancy. Constipation is common for similar reasons.</p>
<p>The muscle coordinating moving one's bowels can be damaged by a tear during childbirth, leading to possible long-term problems. Therefore, it is important for pregnant women to perform the Kegel exercises, which help to strengthen this area, and to discuss any concerns with their obstetrician.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Eosinophilic  esophagitis also known as (EoE) is a chronic disease that occurs in both  children and adults resulting in inflammation or irritation of the esophagus (the  food tube).

Allergens are substances that a person is allergic to such as  specific foods, plants, trees etc. </p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Symptoms of EoE are  non-specific and are usually not enough to make a definite diagnosis without  additional testing. Infants and toddlers with EoE often have feeding problems,  vomiting and poor weight gain. Older school-aged children may have vomiting and  abdominal pain, and adolescents may complain of the feeling of food getting  stuck (known as dysphagia), especially with solid meals. Dysphagia can lead to  food impaction, where food suddenly gets stuck in the esophagus leading to chest  pain, choking, drooling and difficulty swallowing. If a food impaction occurs,  an emergency endoscopy or scope procedure may be required to remove the food  that is stuck. </p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>Taking a thorough  medical history is usually enough to raise the suspicion of EoE. However, a  definitive diagnosis can only be made by performing a gastrointestinal  endoscopy also know as an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) and taking biopsies  in the mid/upper and lower esophagus. Findings seen at the time of endoscopy may  include white plaques, furrows, strictures and rings in the esophagus, but  these signs are not necessarily specific to the diagnosis of EoE. A biopsy is  required to make the diagnosis. </p>]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:meta_key><![CDATA[_acg_gi_patients_cpt_basics_sectioncontent_6]]></wp:meta_key>
			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>  The treatment of EoE  consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Elimination of  the triggers of inflammation and</li>
<li>Treatment or  prevention of the underlying inflammation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Allergy testing is frequently  done for patients to identify potential allergens and other allergic diseases because  children with EoE also are more likely to have allergies. Allergy testing may include  some combination of blood, skin prick and patch tests to screen for potential  food and environmental allergens. </p>
<p>Children with EoE  may respond to a change in their diet to reduce their exposure to specific items  identified as causing problems on allergy testing. Three types of diets may be helpful. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Elemental diet: strict use of an amino acid/hypoallergenic formula  as the sole source of nutrition. These formulas contain proteins that are  broken down to their basic building blocks (either peptides or free amino acids)  thereby reducing the body&rsquo;s reaction to them. </li>
  <li>Elimination diet: changing the diet by removing foods that patients  may react to, as determined by allergy testing (blood, skin prick or patch  testing) </li>
  <li>Common allergen elimination diet: Removing the most common food  allergens (soy, milk, wheat, egg, peanut and seafood). </li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to  evaluation by a pediatric allergist, consultation with a registered dietician  is useful to be sure that a child or teenager still gets the appropriate amount  of calories, vitamins and micronutrients in their diet and to help them  maintain the diet. During treatment it is important to monitor an individual&rsquo;s  height, weight and growth because the disease and its treatment may slow the growth  of children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Medications that may  be used either alone or in conjunction with diet changes include: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Steroids: These  medications may be used to decrease the inflammation seen in the esophagus and  decrease symptoms of difficulty swallowing, vomiting and gastroesophageal  reflux. Depending on the amount of inflammation, steroids may be given orally  for a short amount of time. Oral or intravenous (through an IV) steroids are useful  in emergency situations for individuals with significant swallowing problems or  weight loss, and for those who have been hospitalized for poor intake. Because  of the potential side effects of frequent or long-term use, such treatment is  not recommended except in more severe cases. Children on long-term steroids  should be monitored for potential adverse impact on bone health and growth  issues </p>
<p>To minimize the  steroid side effects, a topical steroid may be prescribed as a maintenance  therapy to keep the inflammation quiet. The medication is typically sprayed  from an inhaler and swallowed into the esophagus. A viscous (thick liquid) form  of steroids is also available. After using topical steroids, children should  rinse out their mouths because residues of the medicine in the mouth can leave  them at an increased risk for an oral infection known as thrush, which may  worsen feeding difficulties and cause pain. Children on long-term topical  steroids should be monitored for growth issues although the effects on growth  are minimal or absent due to the very limited amount of topical steroids taken  up into the body. </p></li>
<li><p>Acid reducing  medications: Medications that decrease stomach acid production, which include H2 receptor  antagonists or proton pump inhibitors. These may also help with relieving  further irritation to the esophagus from stomach acid. They are typically given  1-2 times per day and many different brands are available for over the counter  or prescription use. These medicines should be used under the guidance of a  physician. Some patients will improve with the use of a proton pump inhibitor. </p>
<p>In some centers,  repeat endoscopy may be performed to confirm that the inflammation is gone or  is improving. Other centers may choose to follow patients based on their symptom  improvement. If endoscopy is being used to determine if a patient is responding,  once the endoscopy shows improvement of inflammation, families may be asked to  reintroduce one food at a time. This may help to identify specific allergens  leading to symptoms and to see if more foods can be tolerated in the diet.  Currently, less invasive tests such as blood tests to help follow whether  treatments are effective and check for disease recurrence are not readily  available. </p></li>
<li><p>Newer medications  such as humanized monoclonal antibodies to IL-5 (Interleukin- 5) which is given  through an intravenous line, are being studied in adult and pediatric patients  to see if they are helpful in reducing inflammation and clinical symptoms.  These medications are not yet available for clinical use in the United States. </p>
<p>Narrowing of the  esophagus due to chronic scarring may occur in some patients with EoE. These  are called esophageal stricture(s). These strictures may need to be addressed  and treated by endoscopic dilation (stretching) if they do not respond to medicines. </p></li>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<p>  Functional gastrointestinal disorders are common in children  and adolescents with complaints of abdominal pain. Our brains and our GI tracts  are closely connected (the âmind-body connectionâ). Functional GI conditions  are due to a combination of extra sensitivity of the GI tract, with changes in  the motility or movement of the digestive system. Our stomachs and intestines  are moving food all the time, and some people feel this more intensely than  other people. Itâs as if the âvolumeâ has been turned up from their GI tract. When  their brains receive these sensations, its reaction can change the motion of  the GI tract. These conditions are common, sometimes run in families, and are  usually found in individuals who are otherwise healthy. In children, that means  they are growing well, have normal lab and x-ray results, and donât have âalarm  symptomsâ like blood in the stool, weight loss or fevers. </p>
<p>  The most common pediatric functional GI condition is  functional abdominal pain. Children with this disorder usually experience  recurrent pain in the middle of the abdomen. The pain may be severe, and  commonly results in the child missing school and other activities. Â After taking a detailed history and performing  a physical exam to see if the picture fits with functional abdominal pain and  does not point in another direction, the doctor may recommend screening tests. Depending  on the situation, these may include basic tests on blood, urine and stool, and  imaging of the abdomen (e.g. ultrasound or x-rays). If those tests are normal  (as expected in functional pain) health care providers may concentrate on  making the pain better and returning the child to his/her normal activities. We  search for common things that can worsen functional pain, like constipation, stress  and various foods or additives in the diet. Having the patient keep a symptom  diary also noting what they ate and drank, what they did each day and how their  stools were can be really helpful, and helps the child feel like a part of the  team along with his/her parents and the doctor. There are many different things  that can be done to help the child feel better, and the process starts with the  child and parents understanding the diagnosis, and knowing that although the  pain is real and often intense, it is a âsafeâ condition to have. </p>
<p>  When the abdominal pain or discomfort is relieved by  stooling or is connected with a change in the frequency or consistency of the  stool, we call that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patients with this  condition can have mucus (but not blood) in the stool and feel and look  bloated. Sometimes they get the urgent need to stool when stressed, such as  before a performance or test. When there is diarrhea involved we usually want  to be sure there is no infection in the stool, and no large intake of sweetened  clear liquids that may be causing or worsening the symptoms.</p>
<p>  When the pain is in the upper abdomen and not related to  stool changes, the term âfunctional dyspepsiaâ is used. If the child is taking  medications called âNSAIDsâ also known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  medications (like ibuprofen, Motrinâ¢, Aleveâ¢ and Advilâ¢), it  may be helpful to stop or reduce them as they may be contributing to the pain. Sometimes  children with dyspepsia are given a course of acid-reducing medication, but if  the problem continues, the doctor may do a scope test (âupper endoscopyâ or  âEGDâ) to look for ulcers, acid reflux and stomach infections.</p>
<p>Treatments for functional gastrointestinal disorders differ  based on what symptom is affecting the patient the most. These may include  medications to decrease or increase movement of stool through the intestinal  tract, decrease stomach acid, decrease intestinal spasm, change the mix of  bacteria in the intestine, or decrease the amount of GI tract sensations that  are reaching the brain. There are also important non-medicine treatments such  as relaxation techniques, biofeedback, self hypnosis and specialized diets. As  more research is done, the treatment options change. This, plus the fact that  each patient is an individual means that it is best to discuss these choices  with your childâs doctor. </p>
<p>If you think your child may have one of these conditions,  talk to your doctor. You may also get more information at  <a href="http://www.gikids.org/" target="_blank">www.gikids.org</a>.</p>]]></wp:meta_value>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/pediatric-gi-childhood-obesity/" class="faqquestion">What is childhood obesity and how is it measured?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Obesity is the term used to describe someoneâs weight when it is considered unhealthy because it is too high.  <strong>17% (12.5 million) of American children are obese. </strong>  Obesity typically happens over a long period of time when children take in more calories than they use. Some children are obese because they are more genetically prone to weight gain, others are obese because they eat too many high calorie foods, and others are obese because they do not get enough exercise.  All of these can be due to a number of factors including decreased access to healthy foods or unsafe parks for getting exercise, among many other causes. Typically, obesity happens because of a combination of these things.</p>

<p>When discussing weight, we use Body Mass index or BMI, a ratio of weight and height, and plot it on the appropriate growth curve to compare a child to their peers.  People can be classifiedâfrom lowest to highestâas underweight, normal/ideal weight, overweight, or obese, with subdivisions in obese for âmorbidly obese.â </p>
<p>Your childâs doctor, nurse and/or school nurse may tell you that your child is overweight or obese using growth curves and by calculating the childâs BMI. Schools are becoming more aware of obesity in children and are screening children for these issues.  Schools may send home letters informing you that your child is overweight or obese after measuring weights and heights at school.  It is important to discuss this with your childâs pediatrician. </p>
<table align="center">
<tr>
<td colspan="2" align="center" width="620"><strong>BMI value is calculated using the following equations: </strong></td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td><strong>English (Pounds/Inches): </strong>BMI = (Weight in Pounds/(Height in inches x Height in inches)) x 703</td></tr>
<tr align="center">
<td><strong>Metric (Kg and meters): </strong>BMI = (Weight in Kilograms/(Height in meters x Height in meters))</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The actual value of the normal BMI varies by age in children and teenagers and therefore BMIs must be plotted on a growth curve to determine if they are elevated or not.</p>

<p><strong>BMIâs from the 85th percentile to 95th percentile for age are considered overweight.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BMIs higher than the 95th percentile for age are considered obese.</strong></p>

<p>You can also use <a href="http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/" target="_blank"> this BMI Calculator</a> from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/pediatric-gi-childhood-obesity/" class="faqquestion">What complications are associated with childhood obesity?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There are many complications of childhood obesity.  In general, obesity can decrease life expectancy by approximately 20%, which is about 15 years.</p>
<p><strong>Obesity increases childrenâs risk of many conditions outlined below including (see Figure 1):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cardiovascular disease or Heart Disease</strong>âChildren with obesity are at an increased risk over their lifetime of heart attacks and strokes because obesity leads to increased cholesterol in the bloodstream.  This cholesterol can deposit in the arteries and cause heart attacks and strokes when they are older.</p>
<p><strong>Diabetes</strong>âChildren with obesity are at high risk of developing problems with Type II Diabetes in childhood and later in life.  Children more commonly develop insulin resistance, which can lead to diabetes.  Diabetes carries its own risks of complications including blindness from diabetic eye disease known as retinopathy, blood vessel disease leading to poor wound healing and nerve disease that leads to decreased sensation or feeling in the arms or legs.</p>
<p><strong>Knee and back pain</strong>âIncreased weight can cause increased stress on joints which leads to pain.  This increased weight can also cause degeneration of joints leading to arthritis at earlier ages than people who are not obese or overweight.</p>
<p><strong>Liver problems and gallstones</strong>âExtra body fat can deposit in the liver and cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  If left untreated, NAFLD can eventually progress to liver cirrhosis and liver failure.  Obesity can also increase the risk of having gallstones, that can cause abdominal pain and inflammation of the pancreas.  The gallbladder may need to be removed by surgery if this were to occur.</p>
<p><strong>Gastroesophageal reflux and/or Heartburn</strong>âIncreased fat in childrenâs abdomen can increase the pressure in their abdomen and make it more likely that stomach acid, food and liquid can go back up into the esophagus.  This causes irritation of the esophagus, bad breath, and even vomiting.</p>
<p><strong>High blood pressure</strong>âObesity increases the risk of high blood pressure, which can lead to strokes later in life.  High blood pressure can also increase the risk of kidney disease.</p>
<p><strong>Metabolic syndrome</strong>âObesity increases the risk of a group of symptoms together that we call the metabolic syndrome.  These symptoms include high blood sugar levels, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol levels, and increased abdominal measurements. Having this group of symptoms together increases the risk of heart disease and diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep apnea</strong>âIncreased weight around the neck can cause decreased breathing during sleep. This can lead to decreased energy levels during the day, fatigue and problems with concentration during the day. For the same reasons, obesity also contributes to snoring, which can also disrupt sleep too and cause decreased energy during the day.</p>
<p><strong>Cancer in adulthood</strong>âObesity increases the risk of many different types of cancer in adulthood.  These include cancers of the esophagus (food tube), colon, pancreas, and liver.</p>
<p><strong>Depression and low self-esteem</strong>âChildren can be subject to bullying, teasing,and mistreatment by other children because of their weight.  Often, this can lead to low self-esteem, school avoidance, and depression.  Additionally, children may eat to feel better about these thoughts, further worsening their obesity.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<ul>
<li><strong>Sedentary lifestyle/not getting enough exercise</strong>âMore than 2 hours of screen time or time in front of the TV/Computer/Phone/Video game</li>
<li><strong>Poorly balanced diets</strong>: low in fiber and fresh foods, high in junk/processed foods and sugary drinks.</li>
<li><strong>Certain ethnic backgrounds</strong> have been shown to have higher rates of obesity such as American Indian and Hispanic children.</li>
<li><strong>Obese or overweight family members</strong></li>
<li><strong>Children from low-income families</strong> are at higher risk of obesity because higher fat foods often cost less than healthier foods</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Underlying medical problems account for less than 1% of cases of obesit</strong>y, and it is important to discuss this with your pediatrician or family doctor if your child is having additional signs or symptoms that are concerning.  However, it is far more common that children are not choosing the best food options and are not getting enough exercise.</p>
<p>Some misconceptions about childhood obesity include that children will grow into their excess pounds with their next growth spurt. It is important not to use a growth spurt as a reason for not working on diet and exercise in an overweight or obese child.  Many parents may feel that the growth chart does not apply to their children because the entire family has larger body sizes. In reality, it is important that all children are evaluated on the same growth curve.  The healthy weight range for a certain height does not change based on the build of the child or their family members.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p><strong>Lifestyle changes</strong><br>
The first steps in treatment for children who are obese and for children who are overweight are lifestyle changes. Treatment of obesity in children includes changing the childâs energy balance to cause weight loss by expending more energy than the child takes in. This includes consuming a healthy diet and increased activity to help burn more calories. To lead a healthy lifestyle, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the following for all childrenâreferred to as the â5-2-1 Almost none Plan:â </p> 
<ul>
<li><strong>At least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day.</strong> A goal should be to have at least one green leafy vegetable and at least one fruit or vegetable rich in vitamin C such as oranges, strawberries, citrus juices, broccoli, or tomatoes each day.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum of 2 hours of âscreen timeâ for pleasure each day</strong> (not including schoolwork). Screen time includes watching television, playing video games and using computers, tablets and smart phones.</li>
<li><strong>A goal of 1 hour of vigorous physical activity</strong> including playing outside, sports, dancing, etc.</li>
<li>â<strong>Zeroâ or No sugary beverages.</strong> These include soda/pop, juices, and sports drinks.  Children should try to consume only water.  Calories from drinks like soda and juice are considered âemptyâ calories because they provide only calories, but no nutrition. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other tips for weight loss include</strong> limiting portion sizes, drinking a glass of water before meals and waiting at least 20 minutes before asking for a second helping at a meal.  If drinking milk, choosing skim milk over whole milk is best. A few tips for increased exercise include getting 1 hour of sweaty exercise each day or purchasing a pedometer (something that measures the number of steps you take) and making a goal of getting in 10,000 steps a day. It may be helpful to start at 5,000 and slowly work up to this goal.</p> 

<p>The best way to achieve success at weight loss and to fight obesity is to live a healthy lifestyle, as described above.  Having the entire family participate with these changes is a great way to encourage healthy living in all family members.  Weight loss may occur slowly at first, and it is important to be patient and continue dietary interventions and increased activity.  </p>

<p><strong>Medications</strong><br>
If reduced calories and increased activity are not enough, medications may be used in combination with dietary and lifestyle changes to help promote weight loss.  These medications are not indicated when obesity starts, and are limited in the ages when they can be used.  These medications include Sibutramine, which helps to decrease appetite and is approved by the FDA for teenagers over 16 years of age.  Orlistat, known by the brand names Xenical or Alli (over the counter medicines) helps to decrease fat absorption in the intestine and is approved by the FDA for teenage patients between 12â16 years of age.</p>

<p><Strong>Surgery</Strong><br>
If medication is not successful, surgical options-called bariatric surgery- can be used to decrease the size of the stomach.  However, surgical options should be considered a last resort after all other avenues for weight loss have been attempted. Gastric bypass procedures (Figure 2) are the only form of bariatric surgery currently approved by the FDA for use in teenagers, because they are the most extensively studied.  Sleeve gastrectomy (Figure 3) is increasingly used as a type of weight loss surgery in teenagers. Bariatric surgery is reserved for the patients who meet the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>BMI â¥35 kg/m2 and severe complications from obesity such as severe  obstructive sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or severe and progressive nonalcoholic fatty liver disease</li>
<li>BMI â¥40 kg/m2 with more minor complications from obesity.</li>
<li>Physical maturity, or mature bones</li>
<li>History of sustained efforts to lose weight through changes in diet and physical activity.</li>
</ol>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Obesity is the term used to describe someoneâs weight when it is considered unhealthy because it is too high.  <strong>17% (12.5 million) of American children are obese. </strong>  Obesity typically happens over a long period of time when children take in more calories than they use. Some children are obese because they are more genetically prone to weight gain, others are obese because they eat too many high calorie foods, and others are obese because they do not get enough exercise.  All of these can be due to a number of factors including decreased access to healthy foods or unsafe parks for getting exercise, among many other causes. Typically, obesity happens because of a combination of these things.</p>

<p>When discussing weight, we use Body Mass index or BMI, a ratio of weight and height, and plot it on the appropriate growth curve to compare a child to their peers.  People can be classifiedâfrom lowest to highestâas underweight, normal/ideal weight, overweight, or obese, with subdivisions in obese for âmorbidly obese.â </p>
<p>Your childâs doctor, nurse and/or school nurse may tell you that your child is overweight or obese using growth curves and by calculating the childâs BMI. Schools are becoming more aware of obesity in children and are screening children for these issues.  Schools may send home letters informing you that your child is overweight or obese after measuring weights and heights at school.  It is important to discuss this with your childâs pediatrician. </p>
<table align="center">
<tr>
<td colspan="2" align="center" width="620"><strong>BMI value is calculated using the following equations: </strong></td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td><strong>English (Pounds/Inches): </strong>BMI = (Weight in Pounds/(Height in inches x Height in inches)) x 703</td></tr>
<tr align="center">
<td><strong>Metric (Kg and meters): </strong>BMI = (Weight in Kilograms/(Height in meters x Height in meters))</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The actual value of the normal BMI varies by age in children and teenagers and therefore BMIs must be plotted on a growth curve to determine if they are elevated or not.</p>

<p><strong>BMIâs from the 85th percentile to 95th percentile for age are considered overweight.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BMIs higher than the 95th percentile for age are considered obese.</strong></p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/pediatric-gi-childhood-obesity/" class="faqquestion">What complications are associated with childhood obesity?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>There are many complications of childhood obesity.  In general, obesity can decrease life expectancy by approximately 20%, which is about 15 years.</p>
<p><strong>Obesity increases childrenâs risk of many conditions outlined below including (see Figure 1):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cardiovascular disease or Heart Disease</strong>âChildren with obesity are at an increased risk over their lifetime of heart attacks and strokes because obesity leads to increased cholesterol in the bloodstream.  This cholesterol can deposit in the arteries and cause heart attacks and strokes when they are older.</p>
<p><strong>Diabetes</strong>âChildren with obesity are at high risk of developing problems with Type II Diabetes in childhood and later in life.  Children more commonly develop insulin resistance, which can lead to diabetes.  Diabetes carries its own risks of complications including blindness from diabetic eye disease known as retinopathy, blood vessel disease leading to poor wound healing and nerve disease that leads to decreased sensation or feeling in the arms or legs.</p>
<p><strong>Knee and back pain</strong>âIncreased weight can cause increased stress on joints which leads to pain.  This increased weight can also cause degeneration of joints leading to arthritis at earlier ages than people who are not obese or overweight.</p>
<p><strong>Liver problems and gallstones</strong>âExtra body fat can deposit in the liver and cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  If left untreated, NAFLD can eventually progress to liver cirrhosis and liver failure.  Obesity can also increase the risk of having gallstones, that can cause abdominal pain and inflammation of the pancreas.  The gallbladder may need to be removed by surgery if this were to occur.</p>
<p><strong>Gastroesophageal reflux and/or Heartburn</strong>âIncreased fat in childrenâs abdomen can increase the pressure in their abdomen and make it more likely that stomach acid, food and liquid can go back up into the esophagus.  This causes irritation of the esophagus, bad breath, and even vomiting.</p>
<p><strong>High blood pressure</strong>âObesity increases the risk of high blood pressure, which can lead to strokes later in life.  High blood pressure can also increase the risk of kidney disease.</p>
<p><strong>Metabolic syndrome</strong>âObesity increases the risk of a group of symptoms together that we call the metabolic syndrome.  These symptoms include high blood sugar levels, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol levels, and increased abdominal measurements. Having this group of symptoms together increases the risk of heart disease and diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep apnea</strong>âIncreased weight around the neck can cause decreased breathing during sleep. This can lead to decreased energy levels during the day, fatigue and problems with concentration during the day. For the same reasons, obesity also contributes to snoring, which can also disrupt sleep too and cause decreased energy during the day.</p>
<p><strong>Cancer in adulthood</strong>âObesity increases the risk of many different types of cancer in adulthood.  These include cancers of the esophagus (food tube), colon, pancreas, and liver.</p>
<p><strong>Depression and low self-esteem</strong>âChildren can be subject to bullying, teasing,and mistreatment by other children because of their weight.  Often, this can lead to low self-esteem, school avoidance, and depression.  Additionally, children may eat to feel better about these thoughts, further worsening their obesity.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<ul>
<li><strong>Sedentary lifestyle/not getting enough exercise</strong>âMore than 2 hours of screen time or time in front of the TV/Computer/Phone/Video game</li>
<li><strong>Poorly balanced diets</strong>: low in fiber and fresh foods, high in junk/processed foods and sugary drinks.</li>
<li><strong>Certain ethnic backgrounds</strong> have been shown to have higher rates of obesity such as American Indian and Hispanic children.</li>
<li><strong>Obese or overweight family members</strong></li>
<li><strong>Children from low-income families</strong> are at higher risk of obesity because higher fat foods often cost less than healthier foods</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Underlying medical problems account for less than 1% of cases of obesit</strong>y, and it is important to discuss this with your pediatrician or family doctor if your child is having additional signs or symptoms that are concerning.  However, it is far more common that children are not choosing the best food options and are not getting enough exercise.</p>
<p>Some misconceptions about childhood obesity include that children will grow into their excess pounds with their next growth spurt. It is important not to use a growth spurt as a reason for not working on diet and exercise in an overweight or obese child.  Many parents may feel that the growth chart does not apply to their children because the entire family has larger body sizes. In reality, it is important that all children are evaluated on the same growth curve.  The healthy weight range for a certain height does not change based on the build of the child or their family members.</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p><strong>Lifestyle changes</strong><br>
The first steps in treatment for children who are obese and for children who are overweight are lifestyle changes. Treatment of obesity in children includes changing the childâs energy balance to cause weight loss by expending more energy than the child takes in. This includes consuming a healthy diet and increased activity to help burn more calories. To lead a healthy lifestyle, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the following for all childrenâreferred to as the â5-2-1 Almost none Plan:â </p> 
<ul>
<li><strong>At least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day.</strong> A goal should be to have at least one green leafy vegetable and at least one fruit or vegetable rich in vitamin C such as oranges, strawberries, citrus juices, broccoli, or tomatoes each day.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum of 2 hours of âscreen timeâ for pleasure each day</strong> (not including schoolwork). Screen time includes watching television, playing video games and using computers, tablets and smart phones.</li>
<li><strong>A goal of 1 hour of vigorous physical activity</strong> including playing outside, sports, dancing, etc.</li>
<li>â<strong>Zeroâ or No sugary beverages.</strong> These include soda/pop, juices, and sports drinks.  Children should try to consume only water.  Calories from drinks like soda and juice are considered âemptyâ calories because they provide only calories, but no nutrition. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other tips for weight loss include</strong> limiting portion sizes, drinking a glass of water before meals and waiting at least 20 minutes before asking for a second helping at a meal.  If drinking milk, choosing skim milk over whole milk is best. A few tips for increased exercise include getting 1 hour of sweaty exercise each day or purchasing a pedometer (something that measures the number of steps you take) and making a goal of getting in 10,000 steps a day. It may be helpful to start at 5,000 and slowly work up to this goal.</p> 

<p>The best way to achieve success at weight loss and to fight obesity is to live a healthy lifestyle, as described above.  Having the entire family participate with these changes is a great way to encourage healthy living in all family members.  Weight loss may occur slowly at first, and it is important to be patient and continue dietary interventions and increased activity.  </p>

<p><strong>Medications</strong><br>
If reduced calories and increased activity are not enough, medications may be used in combination with dietary and lifestyle changes to help promote weight loss.  These medications are not indicated when obesity starts, and are limited in the ages when they can be used.  These medications include Sibutramine, which helps to decrease appetite and is approved by the FDA for teenagers over 16 years of age.  Orlistat, known by the brand names Xenical or Alli (over the counter medicines) helps to decrease fat absorption in the intestine and is approved by the FDA for teenage patients between 12â16 years of age.</p>

<p><Strong>Surgery</Strong><br>
If medication is not successful, surgical options-called bariatric surgery- can be used to decrease the size of the stomach.  However, surgical options should be considered a last resort after all other avenues for weight loss have been attempted. Gastric bypass procedures (Figure 2) are the only form of bariatric surgery currently approved by the FDA for use in teenagers, because they are the most extensively studied.  Sleeve gastrectomy (Figure 3) is increasingly used as a type of weight loss surgery in teenagers. Bariatric surgery is reserved for the patients who meet the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>BMI â¥35 kg/m2 and severe complications from obesity such as severe  obstructive sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or severe and progressive nonalcoholic fatty liver disease</li>
<li>BMI â¥40 kg/m2 with more minor complications from obesity.</li>
<li>Physical maturity, or mature bones</li>
<li>History of sustained efforts to lose weight through changes in diet and physical activity.</li>
</ol>

<p>FMT stands for âFecal Microbiota Transplantation,â which is also commonly known as âstool transplantationâ or âfecal transplant.â The main purpose of FMT is to transfer gut organisms from a healthy donor to a patient. </p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="//patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-microbiotaâ¦-bacteriotherapy/" class="faqquestion">What is the microbiota? </a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>âMicrobiotaâ is the collective term coined to describe the community of living organisms (microbes) that literally share our body spaces (such as colon, skin, mouth etc.) It has been reported that numerically, the human body actually contains 10 times more microbial cells than human cells. </p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="//patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-microbiotaâ¦-bacteriotherapy/" class="faqquestion">Are all microbes harmful? </a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Not all microbes are harmful. Microbes that cause disease are called pathogens. Microbes that do not cause disease are called commensals. Many commensals live within and on our body, providing mutual benefits to one another. Not only are they not harmful, they can perform tasks that human bodies cannot, for example, breaking down complex carbohydrates (sugars) that we canât digest, training our immune systems, and modulating inflammation to keep us healthy. </p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="//patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-microbiotaâ¦-bacteriotherapy/" class="faqquestion">What are Probiotics and Bacteriotherapy?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Bacteriotherapy is the term used for the intentional use of bacteria or their products to treat an illness. Probiotics and FMT are examples of bacteriotherapy. Probiotics refers to healthy or âgoodâ microbes (usually bacteria and/or yeast) administered to confer a health benefit. Examples include the use of probiotics to decrease antibiotic-related diarrhea, or FMT for recurrent <em>C. difficile</em> infection. Whereas probiotic products include selected species of beneficial organisms (usually one or just a few), FMT includes the entire stool population of organisms (after screening for the known dangerous or harmful ones).   </p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="//patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-microbiotaâ¦-bacteriotherapy/" class="faqquestion">Who may be a candidate for FMT?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Currently, FMT is used to treat patients with recurrent <em>C. difficile</em> infection (CDI). This infection is often a consequence of antibiotic use, which can disrupt a patientâs microbiome, allowing <em>C. diff</em> to grow unchecked. Clinical studies using FMT have demonstrated nearly 90% cure rates for recurrent CDI as compared to 30% using standard antibiotic treatment.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="//patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-microbiotaâ¦-bacteriotherapy/" class="faqquestion">How does FMT cure recurrent <em>C. difficile</em> infection?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>FMT works by restoring the natural balance of the intestinal bacterial community that has been disrupted by antibiotics. FMT reintroduces a balanced and protective microbiota that suppresses <em>C. dif</em>f, and rebuilds a stable microbial environment in the large intestine.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="//patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-microbiotaâ¦-bacteriotherapy/" class="faqquestion">Is FMT FDA-approved?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>As of late 2015, the Food and Drug administration (FDA) considers FMT appropriate in select patients and only for recurrent <em>C. diff.</em> It is considered an experimental treatment for all other indications. Use of FMT for any other illness or indication should only be done under the direction of a research program. </p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="//patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-microbiotaâ¦-bacteriotherapy/" class="faqquestion">What are the risks of FMT?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>FMT is a new technique. Thus far, very few complications have been described, although minor symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramps, and changes in bowels have been reported. Longer term, there are concerns about stimulating autoimmune diseases, and there may be other, currently unknown risks. Given this, FMT should only be undertaken after the patient and their doctor carefully consider the risks and benefits.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="//patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-microbiotaâ¦-bacteriotherapy/" class="faqquestion">How is FMT delivered to the patient?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>FMT can be performed by different methods. The prepared specimen can be delivered using a feeding tube passed through the nose into the stomach, or by using an endoscope through the mouth that is advanced into the small intestine. More often, it is delivered using a colonoscope, a tube introduced into the large intestine via the rectum, or via a rectal enema. Capsules of FMT for oral delivery are being currently evaluated and may be available soon.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="//patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-microbiotaâ¦-bacteriotherapy/" class="faqquestion">Where does the FMT material come from and how much does it cost?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Until recently, most fecal specimens were obtained individually from screened healthy relatives or friends of the patient who needed the transplant. That remains an option, but is fairly labor intensive and can be costly, because the donor must be individually screened for many infections prior to safely using for a transplant. This can cost &gt;$1000. More recently, however, frozen specimens obtained from pre-screened healthy donors have become available from national stool banks. These banks can screen for even more pathogens (usually &gt;20) than is routinely done individually, and spread the cost out over multiple patients. The cost for oral capsules is still undetermined, but will likely be higher. Insurance coverage for FMT is still being worked out; it is not currently recognized by all payers, and the cost of the test used to administer the FMT (i.e. the colonoscopy) is also another cost. </p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="//patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-microbiotaâ¦-bacteriotherapy/" class="faqquestion">Can I be a donor?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>If you are a healthy individual without any major medical conditions, you might be able to be a donor. You will be interviewed for risk factors. Specific blood and stool tests will be needed in order to ensure no potential transmittable infectious agents will be transplanted to the recipient. If you pass all the screening tests, you can be accepted as a donor. Details of the screening process can be obtained from individual donor sites.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="//patients.gi.org/topics/fecal-microbiotaâ¦-bacteriotherapy/" class="faqquestion">How can I find a doctor who performs FMT?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Check with your primary doctor, local hospital or gastroenterologist, who can refer you to a local provider. There are many private, online websites that maintain registries of providers, as does the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), which can be found at: <a href="http://www.gastro.org/patient-care/procedures/fmt-practitioners" target="_blank">www.gastro.org/patient-care/procedures/fmt-practitioners</a>.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease-ibd-vaccination-schedule-for-adults-age18/" class="faqquestion">Why is it important for me to get vaccines?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>If you suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), general health maintenance is an important part of staying healthy. Part of this includes getting vaccinated. We recommend you get vaccinated to avoid getting sick from infectious illnesses that are preventable.</p>

<p>In general, you will follow the same vaccination schedule as the rest of the population. An important exception to this is if you have a weak immune system from drugs like steroids at high doses, immunomodulators, and certain biologics that we use to treat IBD.</p>

<p>You, your gastroenterologist, and your general physician should work together to make sure you are properly vaccinated. Ideally, this should be when you are first diagnosed with the disease.<strong> It is important to note that you should not receive certain vaccines, called âlive vaccines,â if your immune system is weak from medications we use to treat your IBD.</strong> Remember that there is no evidence to suggest that getting vaccinated will cause your IBD to become active.</p>

<p>Below is a list of medications often used to treat IBD, which can weaken your immune system to varying degrees:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Steroids</strong> (i.e. prednisone) at dosages &gt;20 mg daily for &gt;2 weeks, or exposure to the drug within the previous 3 months at any dose</li>
<li><strong>Immunomodulators</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Azathioprine (Imuran<sup>Â®</sup>, Azasan<sup>Â®</sup>) at dosages &gt;3 mg/kg daily or exposure to the drug within the previous 3 months at this dose</li>
<li>6-mercaptopurine (6-MP, Purinethol<sup>Â®</sup>) &gt;1.5 mg/kg day or exposure to the drug within the previous 3 months at this dose</li>
<li>Methotrexate (MTX, Rheumatrex<sup>Â®</sup>, Mexate<sup>Â®</sup>) &gt;0.4 mg/kg weekly (by mouth or by injection) or exposure to the drug within the previous 3 months at this dose</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Biologics </strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Infliximab (Remicade<sup>Â®</sup>), adalimumab (Humira<sup>Â®</sup>), certolizumab (Cimzia<sup>Â®</sup>), golimumab (Simponi<sup>Â®</sup>), natalizumab (Tysabri<sup>Â®</sup>)</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Vedolizumab (Entyvio<sup>Â®</sup>) is a newer biologic on the market that you may be taking to treat your disease. This biologic, targeted specifically towards the immune system of the gastrointestinal tract , rather than the body as a whole, and as a result does not appear to weaken your immune system like the others listed above.</p> 
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease-ibd-vaccination-schedule-for-adults-age18/" class="faqquestion">What are some other key things I should think about with vaccines?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p><strong>Household contacts</strong><br>
Keeping yourself safe and healthy also means you need to make sure those who live with you are taken into account. If a member of your household receives live vaccines you need to be made aware. If a household member receives a live vaccine and develops a rash, you should avoid contact with the rash.</p>  

<p><strong>Travel outside of the country</strong><br>
You will also need to think about getting the right vaccines to keep you safe when you travel abroad. Itâs always important to let your gastroenterologist know if you are planning to travel outside of the country, because you may need special vaccines if your immune system is weak. In some cases, your doctor may tell you it is unsafe to travel to an area because you are not able to safely receive certain vaccines.</p> 

<p><strong>Pregnant mothers</strong><br>
If you have IBD and have recently given birth, there are also steps you should take to keep your newborn healthy. If you are on drugs like infliximab (Remicade<sup>Â®</sup>) and adalimumab (Humira<sup>Â®</sup>), your baby should not receive a vaccine called rotavirus. This vaccine is usually given to infants. Talk to your pediatrician about your health and the drugs you are taking for your disease.</p>
</div>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease-ibd-vaccination-schedule-for-adults-age18/" class="faqquestion">How do I take charge of my general health?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>It can be tough to keep track of the vaccines you receive over the years. Below is a chart of common, vaccine-preventable illnesses. Use the chart to write down which vaccines you have received, and when. Share this cart with your gastroenterologist and general physician.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/low-fodmap-diet/" class="faqquestion">What symptoms may be associated with FODMAPS?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>As FODMAPs are poorly absorbed during the digestive process, they may pass to the large intestine (colon), where they are rapidly fermented by the bacteria that normally live in the colon. This makes chemicals called short chain fatty acids, as well as gas. This, in turn, leads to changes in the acidity and types of bacteria in the colon. The colon expands, which can lead to pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits.</p>
<p>Diets rich in FODMAPs may increase symptoms in patients with FGD or IBS. However, the FODMAPs themselves are not the root of the problem. For that reason, patients may need to include other options to treat their symptoms. This may include medicine, exercise, meditation, hypnotherapy, etc.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/low-fodmap-diet/" class="faqquestion">What are FODMAP carbohydrates? </a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Examples of FODMAP carbohydrates include polyols (sugar alcohols), which are found in many fruits, vegetables, and artificial sweeteners; lactose, which is found in milk products; fructose, which is the sugar found in fruits, high fructose corn syrup; fructans, which are found in wheat and some fruits and vegetables; and galactans, which are found in legumes (such as beans) and some vegetables. Some, but not all, fibers are rich in FODMAPs and may need to be limited.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/low-fodmap-diet/" class="faqquestion">What foods are suitable, and what should be avoided while on a Low-FODMAP diet?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The following is a list of foods that have high amounts of FODMAPs. It is a difficult diet to follow, especially in the beginning. It may be beneficial to work with a dietician with experience in FODMAP diets to help tailor your diet. Patients can try slowly re-introducing foods if the overall diet is helping. Normally, within a week or two of following the Low-FODMAP diet, patients will begin to have major symptom improvement. It is important to remember that a Low-FODMAP diet is not a life-long diet, but one of removing problem foods and re-introducing foods that do not cause symptoms. You should strictly follow the diet for a few weeks. If you do not get any better, the diet can be stopped. If there is improvement, one can consider carefully reintroducing one food group per week to see if it causes any problems. </p>

<p>The food groups are listed below:</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/low-fodmap-diet/" class="faqquestion">What is the Low-FODMAP diet?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The Low-FODMAP diet was created more than five years ago, in Australia, by Susan Shepherd and Peter Gibson. This diet eliminates certain foods to improve the symptoms of functional gut disorders (FGD). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a type of FGD, may be helped by this diet. IBS is the most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal condition and over half of patients with IBS associate a trigger in their symptoms with eating a meal. (The ACG website has more information on IBS.)</p>

<p>FODMAP stands for Fermentable, Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides And Polyols. FODMAPs are short-chain carbohydrates (sugars) that are highly fermentable (to ferment, is to go through a chemical change that results in alcohol) and poorly absorbed during digestion.</p>
</div>
</li> 

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/low-fodmap-diet/" class="faqquestion">What effects do FODMAPS have on the digestive system?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>When FODMAPs reach the colon (large intestine), bacteria ferment these sugars, turning them into gas and chemicals. This stretches the walls of the colon, causing abdominal bloating, distension, and pain or cramping in many people. Other symptoms, such as diarrhea, constipation, and nausea, are also common side effects of FODMAP carbohydrates. Not everyone has the same reaction to FODMAPs. Ethnicity, genetics, and environmental factors (such as an individualâs microbiome, motility, immune system, and sensory system) may play a part in your bodyâs ability to tolerate these carbohydrates.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/low-fodmap-diet/" class="faqquestion">When is a Low-FODMAP diet recommended?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Eliminating or restricting FODMAPs from the diet may greatly improve symptoms of FGD. In Australia, a Low-FODMAP diet is the main treatment for IBS. It was adopted by their National Therapeutic Guidelines. The Low-FODMAP diet can be adjusted to meet personal food and lifestyle preferences. Following a personally developed Low-FODMAP plan does not cure IBS, but it may lead to drug-free management of symptoms and better quality of life. As with any diet, it is important to discuss with your doctor and working with a GI trained dietician is also useful.</p>
<p>A number of studies suggest that limiting FODMAPs in the diet leads to improved symptoms in one-half to two-thirds of patients who follow this diet. Many patients see improvement in 1-2 weeks, though some may need to wait up to 4 weeks. Bloating and abdominal pain are the most likely symptoms to improve. Diarrhea is more likely to improve than constipation. If there is no improvement after 4 weeks, it is likely not worth continuing this diet.</p>
<p>A Low-FODMAP diet is not recommended for people without gastrointestinal symptoms. Also, if your IBS symptoms improve on the Low-FODMAP diet, you should eventually re-introduce FODMAPs, one at a time, to identify foods that trigger symptoms and those that do not. This will allow a more diverse diet. Keeping a personal food diary may help simplify this process</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease-ibd-vaccination-schedule-for-adults-age18/" class="faqquestion">What is Lynch Syndrome?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Lynch syndrome is a hereditary genetic condition that increases the risk of developing cancer, especially colon cancer.  A diagnosis of Lynch syndrome is made in a patient when a harmful change called a mutation is found in the blood or saliva in one of the five genes that cause Lynch syndrome.  The Lynch syndrome genes include <em>MLH1</em>, <em>MSH2</em>, <em>MSH6</em>, <em>PMS2</em>, and <em>EPCAM</em>. The mutation can be passed on from a parent with Lynch syndrome to their children.</p>
<p>Many Lynch syndrome cancers occur at a younger age.  The highest risk of cancer includes colorectal (up to 70%) and endometrial (up to 70%), followed by ovarian (up to 20%), stomach and small bowel (up to 13%), urinary organs (up to 25%), bile ducts and pancreas (up to 4%), and brain (up to 4%).  Individuals with Lynch syndrome can develop unusual skin tumors including sebaceous carcinoma, keratoacanthomas, and sebaceous adenomas.</p>

<p>Other than skin tumors, there are no physical signs or symptoms that might alert healthcare providers that someone has Lynch syndrome.  However, the cancers that are associated with Lynch syndrome can cause symptoms.

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Lynch syndrome is caused by genetic alterations or mutations in one of the Lynch syndrome genes.  They are known as the âmismatch repairâ genes: <em>MLH1</em>, <em>MSH2</em>, <em>MSH6</em>, and <em>PMS2</em>. When a Lynch syndrome gene is altered, it cannot produce its protein, which is necessary to repair damage that naturally occurs in our DNA (the building blocks that make up our genes).  Without the normal ability to repair DNA damage, cancers are prone to develop.</p>

<li><a href="http://patients.gi.org/topics/inflammatory-bowel-disease-ibd-vaccination-schedule-for-adults-age18/" class="faqquestion">What are the Risk Factors for Lynch Syndrome, and How is it Diagnosed?</a>
<div class="faqanswer">
<p>Lynch syndrome is estimated to occur in 1 in 280 to 440 individuals.  It is the cause of up to 3% of colorectal cancers and 2% of endometrial cancers.</p> 

<p><strong>Family History of Cancer</strong><br>
A diagnosis of Lynch syndrome may be suspected based on a family history of cancer. The types of cancer, number of relatives and generations affected with cancer, and age of onset of cancer in the family can help identify someone or a family at risk of a hereditary colon cancer syndrome (Table 1).</p> 

<p>The Amsterdam I Criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Three or more relatives with colorectal cancer, one of whom is a first-degree relative (mother, father, sister, brother, daughter, or son) of the other two</li>
<li>Two or more generations with colorectal cancer</li>
<li>At least one individual with colorectal cancer in the family who was diagnosed before age 50</li>
<li>The family does not have a different inherited colorectal cancer condition called âfamilial adenomatous polyposisâ</li>
</ol>
<p>Amsterdam II Criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Three or more relatives with HNPCC-associated cancers (colorectal, endometrial, small bowel, ureter, or renal pelvis) cancer, one of whom is a first-degree relative of the other two</li>
<li>Two or more generations with the above cancer(s)</li>
<li>At least one individual with the above cancer(s) in the family who was diagnosed before age 50</li>
<li>The family does not have a different inherited colorectal cancer genetic condition called âfamilial adenomatous polyposisâ</li>
</ol>
<p>About 50% of families who meet the Amsterdam I or Amsterdam II Criteria have Lynch syndrome, meaning they have a mutation in the Lynch syndrome genes <em>MLH1</em>, <em>MSH2</em>, <em>MSH6</em>, <em>PMS2</em>, or <em>EPCAM</em>.</p>

<p>Importantly, many people with Lynch syndrome do not meet Amsterdam I or II criteria.  The diagnosis of Lynch syndrome may be suspected if someone is diagnosed with a colorectal or endometrial cancer before the age of 50 or if a person has been diagnosed with more than one of the Lynch syndrome-related cancers.</p>

<p><strong>Family History of Lynch Syndrome</strong><br>
The greatest risk factor for having Lynch syndrome is having a relative with this condition.  The first-degree relatives of an individual with Lynch syndrome (mother/father, brothers/sisters, and children) have a 50% chance of having the same mutation.  Depending on who else in the family has inherited the mutation, more extended relatives such as aunts/uncles, grandparents, grandchildren, and cousins could also have Lynch syndrome.</p> 

<p><strong>As an example</strong>, Suzie is a 46-year-old woman with colon cancer due to a mutation in the MSH2 gene causing Lynch syndrome.  She has two daughters.  Her brother has two sons.  Both of her parents are still living.  Her brother undergoes genetic testing for Suzieâs MSH2 mutation (see below) and does not have it.  Therefore, he does not have Lynch syndrome and his two children are not at risk of Lynch syndrome.  Both of Suzieâs daughters are tested, and one is found to have the MSH2 mutation.  This daughter has Lynch syndrome.  She has a 50% chance to pass the mutation on to her children. Her other daughter is negative for the MSH2 mutation.  Neither she nor her children are at risk of Lynch syndrome.  Suzieâs mother and father are tested and her father is found to have the same mutation as Suzie.  Suzieâs maternal relatives, therefore, do not have a risk of having Lynch syndrome.  Suzieâs fatherâs brothers and sisters have a 50% chance of inheriting Lynch syndrome, and need to be tested for Suzieâs mutation in order to determine if they also have Lynch syndrome and if their children also have a risk of having Lynch syndrome.</p>  



<p><strong>Screening Tests for Lynch Syndrome</strong> <br>
The best approach to make the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome is by testing a colorectal cancer for genetic alterations seen in Lynch syndrome.</p>  

<p>Lynch syndrome results in damage to genetic areas of DNA called âmicrosatellites.â  A high level of microsatellite damage (âMSI-Hâ) is a sign of Lynch syndrome.  Approximately 90-95% of colorectal cancers caused by Lynch syndrome will be MSI-H. Another tumor test for Lynch syndrome includes immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC colors the proteins produced by genes.  A mutation in a Lynch syndrome gene will result in a lack of staining of the corresponding protein.  Approximately 88% of colorectal cancers caused by Lynch syndrome will have an abnormal IHC result.</p> 

<p>At some medical centers, all patients with colorectal and/or endometrial cancer will automatically have tests of their cancer done to evaluate for Lynch syndrome.  This is called universal testing.</p> 

<p> <strong>Genetic or âGermlineâ Testing</strong><br>
If someone has a compelling personal or family history of cancer, or abnormal MSI/IHC results suspicious for Lynch syndrome, âgermlineâ genetic testing should be considered.  Germline testing is typically done on a blood or saliva sample.  The testing is most often covered by insurance.  Genetic test results can take anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months to complete.  One of the following three results will be found on germline testing:</p>

<ul>
<li>âPositiveâ or abnormal: This confirms that the individual has Lynch syndrome. This also allows the healthcare provider to offer genetic testing to other family members.</li>
<li>âNegativeâ or normal: This means that no Lynch syndrome mutation was found. This negative result could mean a few different things, depending upon whether the patient was the one with cancer, a relative of someone with cancer, or a relative of someone with known Lynch syndrome:</li>
<li style="margin-left:20px">The cancer in the family is not due to Lynch syndrome.</li>
<li style="margin-left:20px">There is a harmful mutation in the gene(s) that could not be found with current genetic testing technology.</li>
<li style="margin-left:20px">There is a harmful mutation in another gene that was not tested.</li>
<li>âUncertainâ or variant of uncertain significance (VUS): A VUS is a genetic alteration that is not established if it leads to disease or has no health consequences.  A VUS can neither confirm nor deny the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome.  It should not be used to test other relatives or determine what type of cancer screening a person needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Genetic testing can be a complex process. Additionally, it can raise medical, emotional, familial, social, financial, legal, and ethical concerns for people at risk of, suspected of, or diagnosed with Lynch syndrome.  It is recommended that individuals pursuing genetic testing have pre- and post-test genetic counseling by an appropriately trained healthcare professional.  This might include a genetic counselor or medical geneticist.  During a pre-testing genetic counseling visit, the healthcare provider will collect a medical and family history to determine if genetic testing, is appropriate. The healthcare provider will educate the patient about Lynch syndrome cancer risks, management options, inheritance patterns, the genetic testing process, and support and counseling related to emotional concerns.  Importantly, information will be shared about insurance coverage and costs for genetic testing, protections against genetic discrimination, and a plan for how test results will be shared with the patient and family members.  Upon completion of genetic testing, the healthcare provider will provide an interpretation of the genetic test results and help the patient understand the implications for their health, as well as for his or her family members. The National Society of Genetic Counselors (<a href="http://www.nsgc.org" target="_blank">www.nsgc.org</a>) has a search feature to find a genetic counselor near his or her home. For individuals who do not have a genetic counselor in their area, there are telephone genetic counseling services available from companies such as InformedDNA (<a href="http://informeddna.com/" target="_blank">informeddna.com</a>).</p>

<div class="faqanswer">
<p>The goal of identifying a patient with Lynch syndrome is to prevent cancer from developing or to find it at an early stage when it is curable or only minimal treatment is required.  There is no way to cure Lynch syndrome.  This includes:</p>

<table class="border">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Organ being screened</th>	<th>Type of screening</th>	<th>Age to start</th>	<th>How often to repeat</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Colon and rectum</td>	
<td>Colonoscopy</td>
<td>20-25 years or 2-5 years earlier than the youngest person with colon cancer in the family, whichever is younger.</td>
<td>Every 1-2 years</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Uterus and ovaries</td>
<td>Biopsies of the uterus lining and transvaginal ultrasound</td>
<td>30-35 years</td>
<td>Every year</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Stomach and duodenum</td>
<td>Upper endoscopy (EGD)</td>
<td>30-35 years</td>
<td>Every 2-3 years</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Urinary tract</td>
<td>Urinalysis</td>
<td>30-35 years</td>
<td>Every year</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
 
<p>While there are other cancers associated with Lynch syndrome, there is no evidence that screening other organs reduces the cancer risk or increases lifetime span.  It would be best to discuss any of the above options with your gastroenterologist and/or genetic counselor to determine which test would be recommended specifically for your situation and family history.</p>

<p><strong>Chemoprevention</strong><br>
Chemoprevention means taking a medication to help reduce the risk of developing a cancer. There is some evidence to show that taking long-term, daily aspirin may help to reduce colorectal and other cancers in Lynch syndrome.  The exact dosage of aspirin is not known.  Any decision to take aspirin should occur after discussion with a physician, taking into account the potential risk of taking aspirin.</p>

<p><strong>Surgery</strong><br>
Women with Lynch syndrome should consider hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the uterus and both fallopian tubes and ovaries) to prevent uterine and ovarian cancer when they have finished childbearing or are over 40 years old.</p>

<p>For individuals with Lynch syndrome who develop colon cancer polyps that cannot be removed safely by colonoscopy, colorectal surgery may be recommended.  It has been shown the risk of recurrent colon cancer in Lynch syndrome is substantially decreased if a longer segment of the colon is removed than in standard colon cancer operation.  This might include a colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (removal of the colon with attachment of the end of the small bowel to the top of the rectum).  The risk of developing another colorectal cancer after an initial colorectal cancer diagnosis and only partial colon resection is 16-19% at 10 years, 41-47% at 20 years, and up to 62-69% at 30 years.</p>
